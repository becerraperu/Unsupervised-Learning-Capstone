      "in the waning days of his presidency, barack obama is waging a final battle     not over legislation or a supreme court seat, but over how he will be remembered. in the latest episode of the   we explore what, exactly, the obama legacy will be. the president is aggressively telling his version, through a major speech broadcast on   tv, interviews and a forthcoming book. but   donald j. trump is telling a very different version, through tweets, speeches and news conferences. who’s will win out? i speak with david leonhardt, an   columnist at the new york times who chronicled the obama administration from the start, and jodi kantor, a reporter whose book, “the obamas,” was just reissued with a new preface. our   conversation explores mr. obama’s impact on race, health care, economic inequality and america’s place in the world. and we seek to answer a question historians may puzzle over for decades: just how consequential was this presidency compared with past white houses? i speak as well to former representative barney frank of massachusetts about whether mr. obama’s relationship with republican lawmakers had to be so adversarial, polarizing and partisan. who was to blame? could mr. obama have done more to get things done using executive orders? mr. frank is blunt. “absolutely not,” he says. “you had a republican majority in both houses that (a) was determined to undercut him politically and (b) did not care if the government was dysfunctional because they don’t like government anyway. and to the extent, by the way, that a failure for the government to perform discredited government, that was a further benefit as far as they’re concerned. ” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(washington     when donald j. trump goes low, congressional republicans go quiet. their tolerance of mr. trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for  . but on one point, all sides agree: they have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. and mr. trump’s provocations are making the republicans’ control of the senate, perhaps even the house, more tenuous. many republicans, even those whose contempt for mr. trump matches their ill will for president obama, still view the choice between mr. trump and hillary clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. they believe that mr. trump, guided by a   congress, will break their way more than mrs. clinton ever would. for others, the vacancy on the supreme court     and its potential to reshape the high court’s rulings for years     overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee’s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts. “the supreme court is probably the choice that will have the single most   effect on the nation,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, where mr. trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly republican state. congressional republicans who are up for       especially the handful like senators john mccain of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire who still face primaries     have made a basic calculation. they have criticized mr. trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. and party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and mr. trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities. alienating mr. trump’s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. their fears at this point appear justified. a poll conducted the last week of july by cbs news found that support for mr. trump among republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent. so the leaders largely responded to mr. trump’s attacks with feigned indifference. “republican elected officials are in a tough spot,” said nathan l. gonzales, the editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report, a nonpartisan newsletter. “they are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. some republicans are reluctant to attack donald trump because they’d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries. ” mr. trump pointedly declined on tuesday to endorse speaker paul d. ryan, the nation’s   elected republican, and verged on outright opposition to mr. mccain and ms. ayotte, just hours after mr. obama challenged republicans to denounce their nominee. both mr. obama and mr. trump have put republicans into an untenable position: criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for       but sitting idly as mr. trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters. “if you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?” mr. obama asked during a news conference on tuesday. mr. ryan’s spokesman tersely responded that the speaker had never sought mr. trump’s endorsement, and ms. ayotte more or less brushed off the matter, saying, “i call it like i see it,” in reference to her defense of a fallen army captain whose family mr. trump had derided. while many republicans are hoping for ticket splitters     those who might vote democrat for president but republican on the rest of the ticket     the parsing is all the more difficult. many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. “in 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,” said fergus cullen, a former chairman of the new hampshire republican party. “it was not like passover, where the door was marked, ‘this one should be spared.’ no, the angel of death came in and said no ‘let’s kill them all.’ ” it is not just a question of individual desires to win       although that certainly drives many of the statements about mr. trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. republicans believe they need to maintain the house and the senate, through a   blend of votes from their base and   split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda. “the speaker’s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,” said kevin madden, a republican operative who once worked for former speaker john a. boehner. “the political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms. ” republican leaders also know that in an   election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the washington establishment. this was the lesson senator ted cruz of texas learned when he was booed from the stage at the republican convention last month for declining to get behind mr. trump, and accounts for some of the heat that senator ben sasse of nebraska, a founder of the never trump movement, has taken from his party back home this year. then, there is the vehement opposition to mrs. clinton, especially how they view her role in the benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among republicans. “i happen to think that lying to the american people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of donald trump,” said mr. chaffetz, the chairman of the house oversight committee. he added: “nothing united republicans more than hillary clinton. ” some still may pull away. on tuesday, representative richard hanna, republican of new york, said he would endorse mrs. clinton for president, calling mr. trump “unfit to serve. ” but mr. hanna is not representative of the broader republican conference. “he came to congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,” mr. gonzales said. “he would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek  . but since he’s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what’s on his mind. ” but if mr. trump falls in the polls and republicans running for   start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for   voters, mr. hanna might not be alone., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(philadelphia     from the time donald j. trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional republicans treated his policy pronouncements     largely out of step with republican dogma     as essentially a distraction. he would talk. they would drive the policies. but now, the question of whether congressional republicans would change president trump or mr. trump would change them has an early answer. mr. trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in flint, mich. they also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that mr. trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5, 000 more border patrol agents. they have stayed oddly silent as mr. trump and senate democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from president barack obama. once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, republicans are now embracing mr. trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during mr. obama’s second term. speaker paul d. ryan, whose own website this week still praised the   partnership trade deal, now applauds mr. trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. many republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, mr. trump’s embrace of both. even on the subject of mr. trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, republicans have often demurred. “the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell of kentucky. mr. trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. “this congress is going to be the busiest congress we’ve had in decades, maybe ever,” mr. trump said. in an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, “we’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. you’re not wasting your time. ” many republicans in congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the obama administration’s decisions to halt the keystone xl and dakota access pipeline projects. “i think he’s completely winning the expectation game,” said representative peter roskam of illinois. “i think he’s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,” he said, adding, “it’s really remarkable. ” in one significant way, congressional republicans potentially seemed to pull mr. trump to their end of the policy pool. on thursday, the administration initially  appeared to endorse  taxing imports as a way to pay for the mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. but the white house later said it was just one option under consideration. “we are in a very good place on tax reform,” mr. ryan said. “it can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it’s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, i think most people agree that this is the right approach. ” congressional republicans are also struggling to keep up with mr. trump’s   announcements, let alone push their agenda. “it’s   stuff,” said senator john hoeven, republican of north dakota. investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see congress take on. “our priorities are the ones we laid out,” he said. they are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda     specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the affordable care act. “we are on the same page with the white house,” mr. ryan insisted thursday. “the president agrees with this agenda. ” but it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation. and the list is much longer. by contrast, last year, senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 senate republican, called democrats’ request for $600 million in aid to flint added to an energy bill “a huge earmark,” adding, “i think it’s not something i could support,” in keeping with most of his colleagues. republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight zika last year. the talk of a spending surge has left some republicans worried about an exploding deficit. “there are going to have to be some cuts,” said representative jason chaffetz of utah. “i am not interested in raising our spending levels. ” senator john barrasso of wyoming, the chairman of the environment and public works committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. “we’re a fiscally conservative group,” he said of the committee. “we’re going to want to see things paid for. ” republicans are also at times confused about what mr. trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on twitter. “‘appears’ i think is the big word,” said representative ryan costello of pennsylvania. “i don’t think anyone in the house of representatives on the republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,” only to have the trump administration send a bill back, he said. republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the house continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later. also notable is the republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised: the use of the executive pen to make policy. several house republicans dismissed the notion that mr. trump would abuse his power to issue executive orders in the way they complained that mr. obama did during his second term. “what you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,” said representative tom reed of new york. mr. trump is also trying to work his will on how the senate operates. in an interview with sean hannity on fox news, mr. trump said he thought mr. mcconnell should get rid of the senate filibuster rule for supreme court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick “obstructionists. ” about three blocks from where mr. trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from city hall to rally against the president. while the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. “i don’t trust anything he says,” said ken snyder, 62., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     the most powerful and ambitious   congress in 20 years will convene tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of american life     refashioning the country’s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the obama administration. even before   donald j. trump is sworn in on jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities     most notably a measure to clear a path for the affordable care act’s repeal. perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new congress is the push for deregulation. also up early: filling a   supreme court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for mr. trump’s cabinet nominees. “it’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,” said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader. “and we intend to do it. ” but as republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of congress for their more partisan goals, democrats are preparing roadblocks. the party’s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of russian election interference, mr. trump’s   cabinet picks and his taunting twitter posts. (on saturday, he offered new year’s wishes “to all,” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. ”) obstacles will also come from republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. and any burst of legislative action will come only if congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. for republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved     the house in particular has signaled the republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. but many of those measures have gathered dust in the senate or been doused in veto ink. the cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent house republican majority in the  . speaker newt gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the senate majority leader, bob dole, who stacked conservative house bills like so many fire logs in the back of the senate chamber. “they’ve been given a golden opportunity here,” said trent lott, the former republican senate majority leader. “but i have watched over the years when one party has had control of the white house and the senate and the house, and the danger is overplaying your hand. “if you go too far, like what happened with obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,” mr. lott continued. “you have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ” the tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the senate finance committee is already moving in that direction. still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from mr. trump’s chief of staff, reince priebus. the senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for mr. trump. republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. but on many issues, senate democrats     including their new leader, chuck schumer of new york     are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of mr. trump’s agenda. “after campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   trump’s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he’s sworn in,” said senator patty murray, democrat of washington. “democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ” republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that president obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the trump team on which ones should be undone. “i hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,” the house speaker, paul d. ryan of wisconsin, said at a recent forum. “i think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ” in late december, the obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. that regulation, one of dozens that mr. trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. but congress is likely to block it, using the obscure congressional review act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion. given time constraints on the senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. they are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. republicans will also move quickly to repeal the affordable care act. they plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year     already a quarter over     that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any democratic filibuster. but republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace mr. obama’s, and they may delay the repeal measure’s effective date for years. the senate must also consider mr. trump’s cabinet picks, and senate democrats are already trying to slow the process. however, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than supreme court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with mr. trump’s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. republicans have been particularly upset that senator jeff sessions of alabama, whom mr. trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with democrats on the senate judiciary committee or had meetings canceled. senator dianne feinstein of california postponed her meeting with mr. sessions until january because, she said, her schedule got too busy. “the senator doesn’t want to rush,” said her spokesman, tom mentzer. one reason that democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over mr. mcconnell’s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the supreme court nomination of judge merrick b. garland. lingering in the background is the specter of russia. democrats     and some republicans, who are at odds with mr. trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him     want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. the obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. while republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. “this is no time for hubris,” mr. mcconnell said. “you have to perform. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     house republican leaders signaled on monday that they would not support   donald j. trump’s threat to impose a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas, the first significant confrontation over the conservative economic orthodoxy that mr. trump relishes trampling. “i don’t want to get into some kind of trade war,” representative kevin mccarthy, republican of california and majority leader, told reporters in response to mr. trump’s threats over the weekend to seek a 35 percent import tariff on goods sold by united states companies that move jobs overseas and displace american workers. speaker paul d. ryan also pushed back against mr. trump on monday in an interview with a wisconsin reporter, saying an overhaul of the corporate tax code would more effectively keep companies in the united states than tax penalties. “i think we can get at the goal here,” he said, “which is to keep american businesses american, build things in america and sell them overseas     that can be properly addressed with comprehensive tax reform. ” mr. trump’s economic positions clashed with traditional conservatives during the campaign, but now these differences     on trade, government spending on infrastructure, and tax policies     have set the incoming president on a perilous course with the lawmakers whose support he needs to keep his agenda on track. “there will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 percent for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, a. c. units etc. back across the border,” mr. trump said in a series of twitter messages over the weekend. the response from republican leaders underscored the limits of legislating 140 characters at a time on twitter, and gave democrats cause to believe they can work with mr. trump to outmaneuver congressional republicans next year. “the   won in part by campaigning against the republican establishment on many economic issues,” said senator chuck schumer of new york, the incoming democratic leader. “if he wants to get something done for working families in this country, he’ll have to stand up to them when it comes time to govern, too. ” mr. trump first startled republicans during the campaign when he attacked trade deals, putting himself more in line with senator bernie sanders of vermont than mr. ryan. he repeatedly insisted that trade deals had displaced american workers and harmed the economy, upending two centuries of american economic policies that held trade up as a good thing, a position that republicans have pushed in recent decades. his positions helped imperil president obama’s trade pact with asian nations, the   partnership, and abruptly stop further trade negotiations, which many experts in both parties believe limits the united states in its economic position against china, especially when paired with tariff threats. “i respect   trump for fulfilling his campaign promise to withdraw from t. p. p. ,” representative kevin brady, republican of texas and chairman of the powerful house ways and means committee, said shortly after the election. “we can’t abandon these markets to china and other competitors, because american businesses and customers will lose out,” he added. mr. trump made republicans bend to his will     and against their   opposition to picking “winners and losers” in the economy     even before his inauguration when he announced last month that the     manufacturer carrier would keep roughly 1, 000 jobs in the state rather than moving them to mexico, thanks to $7 million in tax incentives negotiated by vice   mike pence, the current governor of indiana. this is the sort of package republicans have traditionally loathed. the once intensely conservative mr. pence channeled the views of mr. sanders when he explained the carrier deal by saying, “the free market has been sorting it out, and america’s been losing. ” mr. ryan and many other fiscal conservatives appeared to agree. “everyone here knows what it means to lose jobs in their districts,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma. “if trump can keep a thousand families from going through such an ordeal, then good for him. and if it makes other companies think twice about the human consequences of their business decisions, so much the better. ” but big tariffs appear too much to abide. both mr. ryan and senator mitch mcconnell, republican of kentucky and the majority leader, supported a bill that gave mr. obama and his successor special “fast track” authority to negotiate trade agreements, and are proponents of reducing tariff barriers. “tax cuts and deregulation will make the american economy great again, but tariffs and trade wars will make it tank again,” david mcintosh, president of the conservative group club for growth, said in a statement, adding, “the majority leader is right to caution against protectionism and to urge a robust debate on free markets and trade. ” house leaders want to tackle the problem of companies’ moving operations overseas with a broad rewriting of the corporate tax code, which they say will make american manufacturing more competitive without resorting to punitive measures on individual companies. “tough talk plays well with his base and is arguably even long overdue,” said brian walsh, a republican consultant and former official at the national republican senatorial committee. “but ultimately, the legislative focus will be on tax reform and deregulation versus tariffs and trade wars. i don’t believe republicans will let a golden opportunity to finally pass comprehensive tax reform fall victim to intraparty squabbling. ” republicans also fought mightily this week to remove a provision from a water bill favored by democrats     and aligned with mr. trump’s campaign promises     that would require the use of   iron and steel for domestic water infrastructure projects. they said they feared the measure would direct federal funding to some domestic companies but not others. mr. trump has long been a proponent of propping up the american steel industry, even though he has used imported steel for some of his building projects. next on the horizon could be a medicare fight. mr. trump said during his campaign that threats to change the program caused his party to lose its bid for the white house in 2012,   mr. ryan in his swipe. mr. trump and mr. ryan are in   mode at present, but how much that holds up remains to be seen. mr. ryan has a proposal to transform the medicaid program into a block grant and change the medicare program so that americans now under 55 would get a specified amount of money from the federal government toward the premium for private health coverage. mr. trump has been inconsistent on the medicare issue, and his choice for secretary of health and human services, representative tom price, shares mr. ryan’s views., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(how exactly did alec baldwin construct his mischievously exaggerated,   searingly funny portrayal of donald j. trump on “saturday night live”? in the latest episode of “the ” he explains at length, switching in and out of the  ’s character as he describes his comedic craft. here, he recalls his anxious, improvised debut as mr. trump: i spoke with sarah maslin nir, my colleague who conducted (and, thankfully, recorded) the original conversation with mr. baldwin, his first interview about the comedic role. the liberal mr. baldwin concedes that he holds the   in low regard. but that has not stopped him from becoming a close student of mr. trump’s every physical quirk and verbal tic     he is particularly taken with mr. trump’s tendencies to pause “and then what he comes to is something that you didn’t really have to pause to come up with that. ” but is the performance an act for the sake of comedy or an act of political rebellion? “i’m here doing a show,” mr. baldwin says. “i’m a performer, an actor that’s here doing a show. it’s a great part. ” that said, he isn’t shy about where he stands. “i don’t hate him. i want him to enjoy his life. i just want him to not be the president of the united states     as quickly as possible. ” as a satirical version of mr. trump, mr. baldwin now deals with an unexpected dilemma, for him, anyway: is his portrayal making the new president more human, and thus, more sympathetic? ms. nir asked him about that, too. that’s the fake mr. trump. the real mr. trump had a busy and consequential week, grappling with   global affairs in germany, turkey, russia and syria that are challenging a presidency focused on domestic economic revival. what did we learn about his interest and influence over international events? i put that question to the white house reporters maggie haberman and mark landler.   almost always remain silent on foreign policy until their inauguration, to avoid confusing the world about who, exactly, is commander in chief. on this, mr. landler and ms. haberman agree: mr. trump, and his very active twitter account, have no interest in abiding by that practice. “he doesn’t subscribe to the old idea that the country has one president at a time,” mr. landler says. ms. haberman questions how much we can deduce about his policy once in office from his current behavior. “when it is not trump triangulating against obama and trump actually having to be the only president, i don’t know what we’re going to see in terms of foreign policy. it’s a little easier for him to do this right now. ” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(tucson, ariz.     senator john mccain does not say much these days about donald j. trump’s attack on his   years as a prisoner of war. instead, he clenches his teeth and says he will support the republican party’s presumptive nominee, who once said derisively about the senator’s time in captivity, “i like people that weren’t captured. ” in the   swelter here in arizona, his home state, mr. mccain, who was the republicans’ presidential nominee and   in 2008, did not openly bemoan this moment from his long political life. he is focusing on what he considers his toughest   fight yet, and is betting that the only way to keep his seat is to support mr. trump. “i’m fair game. i’m in the arena,” said mr. mccain, 79, whose thinning face reflects the decades he has spent traveling around his massive and increasingly diverse state. still, the episode sits with traces of bitterness, like old coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup, even if he says otherwise. for a moment, the july attack on mr. mccain seemed to be mr. trump’s undoing. mccain said he recalled a recent chat with a world war ii veteran who had been in a german prison camp. as he delivered the man a missing medal, “he said to me, ‘why would trump say something like that about us?’ ” the senator said. “frankly, i didn’t have an answer for it. ” but mr. trump has since called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a wall at the mexican border, and now the billionaire businessman could be the force that ultimately topples the indomitable mr. mccain. an estimated 433, 000 hispanics are expected to vote in arizona this november, an 8 percent increase from 2012. and mr. mccain has a credible democratic challenger, representative ann kirkpatrick, who grew up on an indian reservation and has strong support from the state’s sizable native american population. “i just came from a latino round table, and they are really concerned about mccain’s support for trump,” she said tuesday. “it’s very personal here. ” she is working with the state’s democrats to harness these forces against mr. mccain and his old guard, which is largely behind mr. trump. ms. kirkpatrick said that being   “is a strong message,” but she acknowledged that “it’s not the only message. ” she recently opened a field office in tempe, and has many arizona state university volunteers working the phones. working out of an old bank, aides sit in the former vault (the door has been removed) to go over mr. mccain’s statements, year by year, and look for inconsistencies that suggest too long a stay in congress. “the race comes down to whether arizonans take a step back and judge john mccain for being john mccain and his remarkable life of public service,” said grant woods, a former state attorney general and the senator’s friend for decades. “and not as being a   incumbent, and not as a republican in a year when the party has a controversial nominee. if they do that, he will win walking away. if they don’t, then it could be tight. could he lose? yeah. ” despite the personal attacks by mr. trump on the senator’s integrity and war record, mr. mccain cannot afford to reject mr. trump and alienate his many supporters in arizona if he hopes to hold his seat, an agonizing  . mr. mccain is the embodiment of much that voters in both parties, but especially fans of mr. trump, have said they would like to jettison this year. he is the ultimate establishment player, having served in congress for nearly four decades     five terms in the senate alone. “back in the middle ages, i was known as the maverick,” mr. mccain said, smiling wanly. he is an unapologetic free trader, an interventionist abroad who continues to defend the deeply unpopular war in iraq, a supporter of private industry and markets, and the original, if inconstant, champion of changes to the immigration system that would help some illegal immigrants become citizens. to succeed in what most people believe will be his last political campaign, mr. mccain must canter around the state assuring mr. trump’s detractors that he does not share the businessman’s visions for mass deportation and the dissolution of nato, while continuing to woo an angry republican base that overwhelmingly voted for mr. trump in the state’s march primary. “i’ve been feeling it out there for some time,” mr. mccain said. “in the southern part of the state here, they are not feeling the recovery at all. then there is this whole issue with these young people and kids carrying around all this debt. ” “that’s the bernie effect,” he said, referring to senator bernie sanders’s youth appeal in the democratic primaries. he added: “the turmoil in this race is more than i’ve ever seen. younger, newer voters are registering for only one reason, to vote against trump. so my challenge is to convince that younger, newer voter that i am for them. ” his greater challenge may be with latinos angry at mr. trump. according to an analysis of voter and census data by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials educational fund, latinos are expected to account for 17 percent of arizona’s registered electorate this year, with a voter turnout rate at close to 70 percent. nearly 45 percent of latino registered voters are democrats, the report found. “i’ve always spent a lot of time with the hispanic community,” mr. mccain said, “but having said that, they are rising in numbers in the voting population. i’m putting more emphasis there, particularly in light of trump’s comments. ” hispanics in the phoenix area will also be heavily motivated to vote in the sheriff’s election joe arpaio, a trump supporter who was recently found in contempt of court for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining latinos, will be on the ballot, trying to keep his seat as maricopa county sheriff. a day watching mr. mccain campaign here this past week reflects his evolving challenges. he sat for the endorsement of a small group of border patrol agents, who have also endorsed mr. trump, and listened in silence as art del cueto, the president of tucson local 2455 of the national border patrol council, explained why mr. trump had gotten their approval. “it means so much to me this long relationship we’ve had,” mr. mccain said about his endorsement, “and the support we’ve tried to provide. ” mr. del cueto did say that “we did talk to donald” about his comments concerning mr. mccain’s war record. “i don’t think it was a comment that has been made again,” he said. but a bit later, meeting with hispanic business leaders, mr. mccain opened with “we’re going to make america great again and it’s going to be huge, o. k.?” it was a tiny swipe at mr. trump, taken in the manner of a toddler grabbing a cookie when he assumes no one is looking. then it was on to other topics, like the federal aviation administration reauthorization. mr. mccain remains most at home with other veterans, like the one he visited     on memorial day, another man waiting on medals. “his wife said he was staying alive to get those medals,” mr. mccain said, smiling at the memory. “sometimes it’s a nice job. ”,

      "(in one letter, donald j. trump ranted about the crisis of unsightly hot dog vendors on his beloved fifth avenue. “having ketchup and mustard splattered all over the sidewalk,” he wrote, “is disgraceful. ” in another note, he paid flowery tribute to his young wife, whom he referred to as “my little darling. ” “you’re everything i hoped for,” he wrote. in a different missive, he offered a rare admission of weakness, declaring, “i am nothing more than a frustrated writer of little talent. ” mr. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, is a master of modern media, exploiting twitter and television to punish his enemies, energize his allies and promote himself. but perhaps his most powerful and memorable form of communication is the   ritual of a personal letter, written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping, signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of trump tower. churned out prolifically from a   desk, they are letters of gratitude, hate, flattery and revenge, dispatched to teenage admirers and   mayors, professional athletes and magazine editors. the tone can range from florid to juvenile, pleading to poisonous. tightly clutched and prominently displayed even by those who despise him, the epistles have become keepsakes and mementos for hundreds of people across the country. viewed as a collection from the 1970s to now, they offer an unusual archive of his emotional ups and downs. the 2009 letter that mr. trump sent to mike tollin, a movie director, makes for painful reading: it denounced a film by mr. tollin that explored mr. trump’s role in the collapse of a football league as “third rate” and “extremely dishonest. ” in a fulminating flourish, mr. trump wrote: “p. s. you are a loser. ” nevertheless, mr. tollin had the letter framed and he keeps it on a shelf in his office, next to photographs of his family. “people come by and immediately want to see it, touch it and hold it,” mr. tollin said with pride. today, as mr. trump tries to make peace with hostile figures in his party, the candidate renowned for his rhetorical flame throwing is deploying a conciliatory style of letter writing as his chief weapon. his handwritten overtures have started to arrive in the mailboxes of seemingly implacable foes, like charlie sykes, a conservative radio host in milwaukee, who has described mr. trump as a “whiny,   bully. ” “charlie,” began mr. trump’s note, scribbled with a thick black pen on the front page of the new york times, next to an article about skeptical republicans warming to mr. trump, “i hope you can change your mind. ” ever attuned to incentives, the real estate mogul dangled an offer: “look forward to doing your show,” he wrote, adding, “i will win!” it did not change mr. sykes’s dim view of mr. trump. but he was, he conceded, impressed by the gesture. “give him credit that he’s doing this,” mr. sykes said. “he’s willing to do some things that might be somewhat at odds with his public image. ” the letters     culled from personal and public archives     reveal mr. trump’s insecurities, but also his perceptiveness about power, ego and what motivates people. from early on, he seemed to intuitively grasp the potency of his praise when lavished on   men. in the 1990s, mr. trump occasionally fawned over new york’s brash mayor, rudolph w. giuliani. in one letter, mr. trump tore out a page from a magazine interview in which he had called mr. giuliani “the greatest mayor that the city’s ever had. ” in case mr. giuliani missed the homage, mr. trump drew two bold arrows, each pointing at the glowing passage, and reiterated the message in a handwritten note: “rudy, you are the greatest!” he wrote, adding, “see you soon. ” there is never any question about authorship: mr. trump’s style of writing sounds virtually identical to his hyperbolic manner of speech, with a healthy sprinkling of the words “great” and “tremendous,” abundant displays of   and    claims of success or doom. in a 1985 letter to mayor edward i. koch, mr. trump predicted new york city’s imminent downfall if a fellow real estate developer, arthur e. imperatore sr. were allowed to start a ferry service between new jersey and manhattan. “real estate values and taxes in new york would plummet,” mr. trump prognosticated darkly. “why would anyone want to live or shop in new york?” (mr. imperatore started the ferry service without destroying new york’s economy.) as a writer, mr. trump sometimes reached, awkwardly but earnestly, for eloquence. in a 1983 letter to a. m. rosenthal, then the executive editor of the times and a lunch companion, mr. trump turned poetic as he tried to capture his reaction to an article that mr. rosenthal had written about returning to  poland for the first time in decades. “it is moving it is sad it is hopeful (?) it is devastating,” mr. trump wrote, saying that his wife at the time, ivana, who grew up in eastern europe, agreed. “it truly captured the strength, the will and the soul of the polish people,” mr. trump wrote. he could write with striking tenderness to ivana, according to notes reviewed by the times. “i adore and love my little darling,” he wrote to her in one. “i truly believe that you are the greatest,” he wrote in another. on the page, anyway, mr. trump was even capable of humility, describing himself as a scribe of “little talent” in a 1985 note to arthur ochs sulzberger, then the publisher of the times. (mr. trump had an agenda: to complain about a reporter he disliked.) mr. trump traces his epistolary habits to his attempt to win over franklin m. jarman, who controlled a manhattan department store that mr. trump wanted to buy in the 1970s to make way for trump tower. mr. jarman rarely replied to mr. trump’s letters, but he had, in fact, read them, mr. trump wrote in his book “the art of the deal,” laying the groundwork for an agreement. “the letters i wrote eventually did have an impact,” mr. trump said. for years, mr. trump sent his letters the   way, by mail. but over time, members of his staff dragged him into the internet era     sort of. he still writes by hand, brandishing the favored tool of teachers’ corrections and athletes’ autographs, a black sharpie. now his aides often turn the letters into digital files, scanning them and sending them by email. but he refuses to let anyone else do the writing. “if i had a secretary to do them,” he said in an interview, “they wouldn’t be nearly as effective, they wouldn’t be nearly as sharp. ” each letter concludes with his extravagant signature, which resembles a city skyline or “a seismograph,” as graydon carter, the editor of vanity fair and a repeat recipient of mr. trump’s screeds, described it. many of his letters targeted the famous and credentialed, but from time to time they reached the little known and uninfluential. mr. trump penned a letter of encouragement in 2014 to an    student in texas, john russell niederer, who had expressed a desire to meet him. “work hard and be smart,” mr. trump told him. the letter now hangs on mr. niederer’s bedroom wall. “for him to take the time to send a message to somebody like me,” he said, “was really, really cool. ” a vindictive side is never far from view in mr. trump’s correspondence. after the basketball legend kareem   wrote a critical essay in the washington post about mr. trump’s candidacy, mr. trump sent him a copy of the essay with a biting message sprawled across it. “now i know why the press always treated you so badly     they couldn’t stand you,” mr. trump wrote. “the fact is that you don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make america great again!” mr.   said he was flabbergasted. “it was such a petty and childish reaction, like a teenage boy responding to being turned down for a date by whining, ‘well, nobody likes you!’ ” he said. he likened mr. trump’s decision to write his reply on the original article to “a dog urinating on a tree to mark its territory. ” mr.   had to get rid of the letter. “i crumpled it up real nice and tight and skyhooked it into my wastepaper basket,” he recalled, invoking his trademark shot. others cannot let go. “i’m definitely going to keep it,” mr. sykes, the radio host, said of his letter. “probably in a desk drawer. ”, Michael Barbaro, 6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.552204\n",
      "(washington     he didn’t see it coming. speaker paul d. ryan was in a hotel room in cincinnati last may when he learned that donald j. trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the republican nomination for president. mr. trump had recently lost the wisconsin primary, which mr. ryan and other republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. senator ted cruz of texas had made strides, and mr. ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. but he badly miscalculated. the ensuing path, from mr. trump’s securing the nomination to mr. ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in wisconsin a month before election day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that mr. trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. mr. ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of reince priebus, chairman of the republican national committee and a fellow wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to mr. trump. now, mr. ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve republican control of congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. if mr. trump is defeated on nov. 8     as mr. ryan has all but conceded     but republicans maintain their house majority, it will fall largely to mr. ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. there is, of course, the question of whether house members would let him do so. the republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the house decision on whether the speaker should be mr. ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies trumpism. democrats have moved quickly to paint mr. ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of mr. trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying mr. ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. on saturday, mr. ryan’s office added to that criticism of mr. trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for mr. ryan. for his part, mr. trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of mr. ryan. last week, in a series of twitter posts, he called mr. ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee. ” for now, the speaker spends his days treating mr. trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of hillary clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered house republicans. “right now his objective is crystal clear,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma, “to retain the republican majority in the house. in that effort he has helped members of the freedom caucus as well as those in the tuesday group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “we will worry about our internal differences after the election. right now we are in a bar fight and every republican is worth saving. ” that mr. ryan and mr. trump were never natural allies is understandable. they had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the white house, an encounter at a   in new york during the 2012 campaign. mr. ryan was mitt romney’s running mate. their paths would not cross again. “trump really wasn’t on paul’s radar screen,” said a. mark neuman, a ryan friend for two decades. “before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that mr. trump did not share mr. ryan’s passions for the green bay packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and midwest life with children. the relationship showed strains from the start, with mr. ryan alarmed by mr. trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. the speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to mr. trump for other republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “if we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. he made calls to several of the republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda mr. trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (the trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. mr. ryan also declined to be interviewed.) mr. ryan had hoped that mr. trump would eventually embrace his plan. when mr. trump clinched the nomination in may, mr. ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “the conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘don’t worry, this will end,’” said charlie sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in milwaukee and a friend of mr. ryan’s. “so it was a huge shock. i think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” with campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, mr. ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse mr. trump. none of this pleased mr. priebus, who prided himself on building the modern republican party in wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against mrs. clinton. in text messages and phone calls, mr. priebus tried to persuade mr. ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept mr. trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. mr. trump would yell at mr. priebus and in turn mr. priebus would needle mr. ryan. when that did not work, mr. trump claimed mr. ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to capitol hill to try to woo fellow republicans, a claim mr. ryan viewed as a serious breach. “that was the first realization that trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate mr. trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” in june, after a period of relative silence on mr. trump’s part, mr. ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. staff members of both men began to coordinate for the republican national convention. but days later mr. ryan aggressively criticized mr. trump for his remarks about a hispanic judge. another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “he was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” mr. sykes said. a bright spot came in july, when mr. trump chose indiana’s governor, mike pence, who has long been close to mr. ryan, as his running mate. privately, mr. pence tried to assure skeptical republicans that he would impose mr. ryan’s policy agenda if he and mr. trump captured the white house. then in august, mr. trump toyed with endorsing mr. ryan’s opponent in a primary. mr. ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. he watched mr. trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. mr. trump called mr. ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of mr. pence, and to seek debate advice, which mr. ryan said focused on preparation. (not heeded.) by the fall, mr. ryan had basically stopped speaking mr. trump’s name. the nominee made a request through the r. n. c. to campaign with mr. ryan, whose team agreed to invite mr. trump and mr. pence to an event this month in wisconsin. then came the tape of mr. trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. mr. sykes let mr. priebus know via text that mr. trump was no longer welcome in wisconsin. mr. sykes said mr. priebus responded: “i am the guy trying to fix this! i am in tears over this. ’” (a spokeswoman for mr. priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) mr. ryan agonized over his options. ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “i think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, who has renounced mr. trump. “his job is to help house republicans. period. ” mr. ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support mr. trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “we knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” mr. sykes said. “how much damage could they do?”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)    0.551154\n",
      "(when tony schwartz was writing donald j. trump’s first book, “the art of the deal,” in the late 1980s, he was startled by his client’s short attention span. during their first interview, mr. trump endured just a few minutes of mr. schwartz’s questions before leaping up from his chair and declaring the entire exercise a waste of his time. “he couldn’t tolerate doing interviews,” he tells me. “he just couldn’t stay focused for more than a few minutes at a time. and think about this, michael, it was when he was talking about himself, which is his favorite subject. ” in the latest episode of the   mr. schwartz explains why he is sharing his intimate knowledge of how mr. trump thinks and behaves with aides to hillary clinton to help her prepare for monday night’s highly anticipated presidential debate. he’s worried about a habit he noticed during ms. clinton’s performance at a national security forum hosted by nbc news a week ago: “what i would hope is that she doesn’t go the same route she did with matt lauer when he started coming at her relentlessly, which was to revert to her knowledge, to revert to her ability to produce a hundred facts in a short period of time,” he says. “because this debate is going to turn not a bit on the issues. it’s going to turn on emotion, it’s going to turn on which candidate makes all of us feel safer and which candidate makes us feel less safe. and the one who wins that contest wins the debate     and probably wins the election. ” mr. schwartz offered his help to the clinton campaign as part of his long (and possibly futile) effort to make up for the guilt he feels about setting mr. trump on a path to fame by ghostwriting his book. “i don’t think i can ever even the score i don’t think i can ever set it totally straight,” he says. all he can do now, he says, is “say the truth that i know in the service of trying to help save the country and the world from a guy who is exceptionally dangerous. ” in the episode, we explore the profoundly contrasting style of preparation and showmanship that mr. trump and mrs. clinton bring to the debate with my colleagues, frank bruni, an opinion columnist, and amy chozick, a reporter who has covered mrs. clinton for the last two years. “i think of trump as a toddler sitting in a high chair,” mr. bruni says. “and his advisers are saying ‘donald, you must get through the meal without throwing your spaghetti on the wall.’ so the question is, will they successfully persuade him not to throw his spaghetti on the wall before the debate ends?” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(york, pa.     senator patrick j. toomey, republican of pennsylvania, has never met charles kress, but he desperately needs him. mr. kress, 62, will vote for a democrat this november for the white house, he said, no matter what. he is also planning to vote for mr. toomey’s  . “sometimes you have to keep in office the ones who make the deals,” mr. kress said as he watered the flowers in front of york’s unitarian church. republican senators like mr. toomey who are running in swing states     about six, and enough to tip the balance of power in the senate     need voters who would reject donald j. trump to nonetheless pull the levers for the party’s other candidates in november. in some districts, house republicans will need them, too. mr. trump’s convincing sweep of the primaries in connecticut, delaware, maryland, pennsylvania and rhode island on tuesday did little to assuage concerns about his standing with swing voters in november. his victory speech included a bracing broadside against hillary clinton’s playing the “woman card. ” and he continues to trail his opponents, senator ted cruz of texas and gov. john kasich of ohio, among republican women. but   voters in federal races have become increasingly rare over the last two decades, hitting a low in 2012, when only 10 percent of them divided their votes between parties. that was down sharply from 1972. the ranks of   voters have expanded along with the rise in partisanship and its attendant rancor in congress. “there is no doubt that, over all, the era of polarization and   above and beyond idiosyncratic factors     that has to lead to a drop in ticket splitting,” said richard born, a professor of political science at vassar college and an expert on congressional elections. “democrats and republicans alike, as part of the polarization phenomenon, are more consistently liberal or conservative across issues,” mr. born said, “as are the candidates themselves, meaning less likelihood of ticket splitting. ” even in pennsylvania, a state that has elected a senator from a different party than the presidential candidate it chose seven times since world war ii, ticket splitting has decreased drastically in recent elections. “that is probably toomey’s worst problem,” said g. terry madonna, the director of the center for politics and public affairs at franklin and marshall college. it is also a problem for the republican senators kelly ayotte of new hampshire, ron johnson of wisconsin, mark s. kirk of illinois and rob portman of ohio. republicans in washington are increasingly worried for them. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader, and other republicans are openly urging elected officials in their party to focus largely on local issues and their role in bipartisan legislation, and to refrain from tying themselves to the top of the ticket should the nominee be mr. trump. “i think we have to go out and make a case,” said representative scott perry, a republican who represents the york area. “people don’t split their tickets because they don’t have a choice. it’s because they do. i think those people are going to need to be convinced. ” while a polarizing presidential candidate is considered very difficult for republican senators to overcome in swing states, there may be a silver lining for them. some republican donors are quietly plotting to dismiss mr. trump and instead pour their money into senate races where they believe republicans can be saved, as a check and balance to a democrat sitting in the white house for the next four years. “the prospect of trump at the top of the ticket could create an exodus of donors away from the presidential and toward senate and house races,” said kevin madden, a republican strategist. “the potential is there for a concentration of effort and resources geared toward senate races that chuck schumer and his senate democrats may not have been counting on. ” mr. schumer, a new yorker who is poised to become the next leader of the senate democrats, says good luck with that. “if there was ever a national election, this is it,” he said. “they can run from their nominee, but they can’t hide. ” ticket splitting over the last five decades has occurred most often among moderate democrats who have supported a republican for president but voted for democrats for congress. some voters have viewed this as a recipe for compromise and balance, while others have been repelled by the democratic candidates running for the top job. the three strongest years of ticket splitting between presidential and house voting in the last five decades, according to american national election studies survey data, were 1972, when 30 percent of voters did it 1980 (28 percent) and 1984 (26 percent). similar studies show the same trend for senate races. in all three of those elections, a republican won the white house by a landslide at a time when registered democrats significantly outnumbered republicans in the overall population, and when considerably more incumbent house members were democrats. the 1928 election provides a history lesson in what can happen when a candidate, rather than the political mood, drives ticket splitting. that year, al smith, the governor of new york, became the democratic nominee. it was not extreme rhetoric like mr. trump engages in, which has repelled some republicans, that held mr. smith back with voters. mr. smith was a roman catholic, opposed prohibition and was a symbol of modern urbanism. and that combination drove off rural and moderate southern democrats, who outnumbered republicans significantly, contributing to his loss to the republican herbert hoover. while republicans made a net gain of eight seats in the senate that year, demonstrating that ticket splitting does not help all senators attached to the party of a wildly unpopular candidate, many democrats still voted along party lines for the house and senate. in 1996, when it was clear that bill clinton would trounce bob dole, republicans encouraged voters to stick with their party in the down ballot, and newt gingrich, then speaker of the house, cautioned his members to distance themselves from mr. dole. mr. gingrich came up with a parallel house agenda much as speaker paul d. ryan is now doing, and he told members to run on it. “it saved the house and the senate for them,” said mr. born, the vassar professor. “trying to localize the campaigns paid off. ” but republican ticket splitters may make an alternative choice that is equally damaging to mr. toomey’s prospects. “i might just skip the whole thing,” said kristi peyton, 46, a toomey fan who offered her views of mr. trump     “disaster,” “bully” and “unattractive”     over crabs at captain bob’s in railroad, a small town near york. “where republicans can really get hurt is not so much that people vote democrat for congress but that they don’t show up at all,” mr. born said. “this is where the republicans are scared to death. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(as with so many elements of this presidential campaign, the way in which hillary clinton and donald j. trump have handled their medical histories feels strange, secretive and theatrical (dr. oz, anyone? ). but there’s a long and rich history of candidates concealing     even lying about     the details of their health. in the latest episode of the   we talk to john dickerson, a history buff, columnist at slate and moderator of cbs’s “face the nation,” who recalls the united states’ pivotal brush with a president’s   ailment: the heart attack of dwight d. eisenhower in 1955. mr. dickerson, the author of “whistlestop,” a new book about the history of presidential campaigns, explains how the white house’s initial resistance to disclose the incident triggered something new in american public life: a deluge of deeply private medical information about the commander in chief. we also speak with the doctor who, more than anyone else, is responsible for our modern expectation that candidates give detailed disclosures about their health: lawrence k. altman, a reporter at the new york times who was the first to interview candidates about their medical histories. mr. altman recalls his tough and sadly prescient question to ronald reagan when he was a candidate in 1980 about a potential condition that would later haunt him. we also hear from voters in times square about whether they even care about candidates’ health. short answer: not particularly. one voter told us he’d be going with mrs. clinton over mr. trump. was there anything about her health that might change that? “i’m pretty sure he’s crazy,” the man said, “and that’s more dangerous than her dying in office. ” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(there’s a forgotten scene in the third season of “the sopranos” when the wives of the show’s mob crew, sitting inside a local italian restaurant, turn to the delicate subject of hillary clinton, monica lewinsky, infidelity and marriage. it’s 2001 and mrs. clinton is headed to the senate. the women assembled around the table, all of whom know their husbands are unfaithful, are simultaneously disgusted by mrs. clinton and in awe of her. “i can’t stand that woman,” says angie bonpensiero. “i don’t know,” says rosalie aprile. “maybe we could all take a page from her book. ” it’s left to the boss’s wife, carmela soprano to sort through her own messy emotions. she veers from instinctive revulsion (“to be humiliated in public then walk around smiling all the time”) to grudging admiration for how a woman not unlike herself, overshadowed by a cheating spouse, has emerged as powerful, independent figure in her own right. “she’s a role model for all of us,” mrs. soprano says on second thought, as the wives nod in agreement. in the latest episode of the   we examine a potent electoral force we rarely talk about when we talk about the campaign: pop culture. both mrs. clinton and donald j. trump are   stars in their own right, who have spawned     and inspired     television characters and shows from “the apprentice” (mr. trump) to the “the good wife” (mrs. clinton). we talk to the chief television critic at the new york times, james poniewozik, about how television and film characters past and present inform our views of both candidates     or have been created in the candidates’ images. “they are both characters in pop culture, characters in mass media, whose stories we have literally been hearing for decades,” mr. poniewozik says of the candidates. “usually in an election, there’s some narrative of some new character you haven’t encountered before: barack obama in 2008, george w. bush in 2000. here, it’s two   american television serials having a crossover episode. ” so if this   campaign is a crossover television event, how would mr. poniewozik, as a tv critic, review the show? “i think the writers have really taken it over the top. it’s like watching ‘scandal’ in its eighth season where you just feel that they have exhausted every possible trick and they’re emptying their notebooks at you. ” would you commit to another season? “i think i’d like to see it recast. ” and we chat with susan dominus, of the times magazine, about the surprising ways that gender is playing out in pop cultural depictions of mr. trump and mrs. clinton in this campaign, a topic she is studying closely this year. “if we are going to extend gender stereotypes all the way to their worst place, it’s celebrity, lightweight     that reads as in some ways feminine and inconsequential or not perceived as a real threat,” ms. dominus says. and in that sense, mr. trump, in some ways, is the more feminized figure. “for all of his bluster, when was the last time that people were this obsessed with a candidate’s hair?” ms. dominus asks. “it was hillary in 2008!” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(when tony schwartz was writing donald j. trump’s first book, “the art of the deal,” in the late 1980s, he was startled by his client’s short attention span. during their first interview, mr. trump endured just a few minutes of mr. schwartz’s questions before leaping up from his chair and declaring the entire exercise a waste of his time. “he couldn’t tolerate doing interviews,” he tells me. “he just couldn’t stay focused for more than a few minutes at a time. and think about this, michael, it was when he was talking about himself, which is his favorite subject. ” in the latest episode of the   mr. schwartz explains why he is sharing his intimate knowledge of how mr. trump thinks and behaves with aides to hillary clinton to help her prepare for monday night’s highly anticipated presidential debate. he’s worried about a habit he noticed during ms. clinton’s performance at a national security forum hosted by nbc news a week ago: “what i would hope is that she doesn’t go the same route she did with matt lauer when he started coming at her relentlessly, which was to revert to her knowledge, to revert to her ability to produce a hundred facts in a short period of time,” he says. “because this debate is going to turn not a bit on the issues. it’s going to turn on emotion, it’s going to turn on which candidate makes all of us feel safer and which candidate makes us feel less safe. and the one who wins that contest wins the debate     and probably wins the election. ” mr. schwartz offered his help to the clinton campaign as part of his long (and possibly futile) effort to make up for the guilt he feels about setting mr. trump on a path to fame by ghostwriting his book. “i don’t think i can ever even the score i don’t think i can ever set it totally straight,” he says. all he can do now, he says, is “say the truth that i know in the service of trying to help save the country and the world from a guy who is exceptionally dangerous. ” in the episode, we explore the profoundly contrasting style of preparation and showmanship that mr. trump and mrs. clinton bring to the debate with my colleagues, frank bruni, an opinion columnist, and amy chozick, a reporter who has covered mrs. clinton for the last two years. “i think of trump as a toddler sitting in a high chair,” mr. bruni says. “and his advisers are saying ‘donald, you must get through the meal without throwing your spaghetti on the wall.’ so the question is, will they successfully persuade him not to throw his spaghetti on the wall before the debate ends?” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(did hillary clinton, or somebody very much like her, have to be the first woman to get this close to winning the presidency? we explore that question in the latest episode of the   with claire mccaskill, the senior united states senator from missouri, and gail collins, a new york times columnist who has written several books on women’s history. what   combination of factors is required for a country to embrace a woman as its leader for the first time? longtime public exposure? proximity to power? moderate politics? and how powerful, perhaps even necessary, is it that this first woman be the spouse of a former president? history offers a guide: the first female president of any country was isabel martínez de perón of argentina, the wife of its former president. the first woman elected to the united states senate, hattie wyatt caraway, was the widow of a senator. and now the united states has the first woman candidate in the general election. “given our history it’s not surprising it’s the wife of somebody who had the job first,” ms. collins said. “some day we’ll have some really charismatic woman who gets people all excited, and it doesn’t matter that she’s only been in the senate for two years and that we don’t know much about her except her story,” ms. collins said. mrs. clinton’s presidential runs will have paved the way for that woman to have a shot. “no matter what happens in this election, one of the great contributions hillary clinton has made to american history is that she made it seem sort of normal to have a woman running for president in 2008,” ms. collins said. “before then it had never been a normal thing. ” america is behind many other countries on that front, as senator mccaskill pointed out. “many of us are painfully aware of how many countries around the world have elected and admired women executives in their government, and it is embarrassing to many of us that america has not taken that step,” she said. “the irony is that everyone always would pat women on the head and say ‘well you know as soon as a woman is qualified there will be a woman president,’ ” senator mccaskill said. “now we have a stark differential in qualifications, and now it seems to be all about her integrity and how likable she is. ” in the episode, we discuss the challenges of running against a woman with former representative rick lazio of long island, a man who discovered those pitfalls in a very public fashion. in 2000, he was mrs. clinton’s opponent in the race for the united states senate seat in new york. in a   debate moment, mr. lazio approached mrs. clinton’s podium to ask her to sign a pledge, a tactic many saw as an overly aggressive male gesture toward a female rival. mr. lazio told us it was a mistake that he still regrets     and one whose visual impact he underestimated in the moment. “our folks all thought we had won the debate hands down,” he told us. but the next day, he saw that clip played over and over again and realized that the moment was going to stick. “the mistake that i made     and it was a mistake     was to create an optic where it looked like i was somebody other than who i was it looked like i was invading her space and was not chivalrous,” he told us. “it was spun in the media and shown over and over again, and it looked like it was an overbearing male approaching a female. ” please let us know what you think of the  . you can reach us at therunup@nytimes. com, or find me on twitter. you can also rate and review us on itunes. from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(on the eve of our debut episode of “the daily,” president trump delivered a major news story. for his first supreme court nomination, he selected neil m. gorsuch, a conservative judge with a sterling résumé. i spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful new york times colleagues about what it means. maggie haberman, a white house reporter, explains mr. trump’s reverence for the supreme court. carl hulse, the dean of congressional reporters, explains what to expect during the confirmation process. and adam liptak, our chief legal correspondent, introduces the country’s new supreme court nominee. to understand more about judge gorsuch, i also talk to david green, the chief executive of hobby lobby, a company at the center of one of judge gorsuch’s most important cases. he ruled that corporations with religious owners     like hobby lobby     cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. “we voted for trump, not that we agree with everything he does,” mr. green tells me on the show, speaking for himself and his wife. “the most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the constitution,” he said, referring to the supreme court. “because if you rule on the constitution, it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something, and that we would have our religious liberties. ” tune in, and tell us what you think. email us at thedaily@nytimes. com. tweet me at @mikiebarb. and if that isn’t enough, we can even text. if you are on your phone and don’t see an audio player on this page, follow the instructions below. on your iphone or ipad: open the preloaded app called “podcasts” it has a purple icon. if you’re reading this from your phone, tap this link, which will take you straight there.

      "(washington     he didn’t see it coming. speaker paul d. ryan was in a hotel room in cincinnati last may when he learned that donald j. trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the republican nomination for president. mr. trump had recently lost the wisconsin primary, which mr. ryan and other republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. senator ted cruz of texas had made strides, and mr. ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. but he badly miscalculated. the ensuing path, from mr. trump’s securing the nomination to mr. ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in wisconsin a month before election day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that mr. trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. mr. ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of reince priebus, chairman of the republican national committee and a fellow wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to mr. trump. now, mr. ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve republican control of congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. if mr. trump is defeated on nov. 8     as mr. ryan has all but conceded     but republicans maintain their house majority, it will fall largely to mr. ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. there is, of course, the question of whether house members would let him do so. the republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the house decision on whether the speaker should be mr. ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies trumpism. democrats have moved quickly to paint mr. ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of mr. trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying mr. ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. on saturday, mr. ryan’s office added to that criticism of mr. trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for mr. ryan. for his part, mr. trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of mr. ryan. last week, in a series of twitter posts, he called mr. ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee. ” for now, the speaker spends his days treating mr. trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of hillary clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered house republicans. “right now his objective is crystal clear,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma, “to retain the republican majority in the house. in that effort he has helped members of the freedom caucus as well as those in the tuesday group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “we will worry about our internal differences after the election. right now we are in a bar fight and every republican is worth saving. ” that mr. ryan and mr. trump were never natural allies is understandable. they had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the white house, an encounter at a   in new york during the 2012 campaign. mr. ryan was mitt romney’s running mate. their paths would not cross again. “trump really wasn’t on paul’s radar screen,” said a. mark neuman, a ryan friend for two decades. “before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that mr. trump did not share mr. ryan’s passions for the green bay packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and midwest life with children. the relationship showed strains from the start, with mr. ryan alarmed by mr. trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. the speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to mr. trump for other republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “if we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. he made calls to several of the republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda mr. trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (the trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. mr. ryan also declined to be interviewed.) mr. ryan had hoped that mr. trump would eventually embrace his plan. when mr. trump clinched the nomination in may, mr. ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “the conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘don’t worry, this will end,’” said charlie sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in milwaukee and a friend of mr. ryan’s. “so it was a huge shock. i think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” with campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, mr. ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse mr. trump. none of this pleased mr. priebus, who prided himself on building the modern republican party in wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against mrs. clinton. in text messages and phone calls, mr. priebus tried to persuade mr. ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept mr. trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. mr. trump would yell at mr. priebus and in turn mr. priebus would needle mr. ryan. when that did not work, mr. trump claimed mr. ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to capitol hill to try to woo fellow republicans, a claim mr. ryan viewed as a serious breach. “that was the first realization that trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate mr. trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” in june, after a period of relative silence on mr. trump’s part, mr. ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. staff members of both men began to coordinate for the republican national convention. but days later mr. ryan aggressively criticized mr. trump for his remarks about a hispanic judge. another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “he was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” mr. sykes said. a bright spot came in july, when mr. trump chose indiana’s governor, mike pence, who has long been close to mr. ryan, as his running mate. privately, mr. pence tried to assure skeptical republicans that he would impose mr. ryan’s policy agenda if he and mr. trump captured the white house. then in august, mr. trump toyed with endorsing mr. ryan’s opponent in a primary. mr. ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. he watched mr. trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. mr. trump called mr. ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of mr. pence, and to seek debate advice, which mr. ryan said focused on preparation. (not heeded.) by the fall, mr. ryan had basically stopped speaking mr. trump’s name. the nominee made a request through the r. n. c. to campaign with mr. ryan, whose team agreed to invite mr. trump and mr. pence to an event this month in wisconsin. then came the tape of mr. trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. mr. sykes let mr. priebus know via text that mr. trump was no longer welcome in wisconsin. mr. sykes said mr. priebus responded: “i am the guy trying to fix this! i am in tears over this. ’” (a spokeswoman for mr. priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) mr. ryan agonized over his options. ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “i think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, who has renounced mr. trump. “his job is to help house republicans. period. ” mr. ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support mr. trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “we knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” mr. sykes said. “how much damage could they do?”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)    0.520205\n",
      "(washington     when donald j. trump goes low, congressional republicans go quiet. their tolerance of mr. trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for  . but on one point, all sides agree: they have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. and mr. trump’s provocations are making the republicans’ control of the senate, perhaps even the house, more tenuous. many republicans, even those whose contempt for mr. trump matches their ill will for president obama, still view the choice between mr. trump and hillary clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. they believe that mr. trump, guided by a   congress, will break their way more than mrs. clinton ever would. for others, the vacancy on the supreme court     and its potential to reshape the high court’s rulings for years     overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee’s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts. “the supreme court is probably the choice that will have the single most   effect on the nation,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, where mr. trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly republican state. congressional republicans who are up for       especially the handful like senators john mccain of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire who still face primaries     have made a basic calculation. they have criticized mr. trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. and party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and mr. trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities. alienating mr. trump’s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. their fears at this point appear justified. a poll conducted the last week of july by cbs news found that support for mr. trump among republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent. so the leaders largely responded to mr. trump’s attacks with feigned indifference. “republican elected officials are in a tough spot,” said nathan l. gonzales, the editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report, a nonpartisan newsletter. “they are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. some republicans are reluctant to attack donald trump because they’d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries. ” mr. trump pointedly declined on tuesday to endorse speaker paul d. ryan, the nation’s   elected republican, and verged on outright opposition to mr. mccain and ms. ayotte, just hours after mr. obama challenged republicans to denounce their nominee. both mr. obama and mr. trump have put republicans into an untenable position: criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for       but sitting idly as mr. trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters. “if you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?” mr. obama asked during a news conference on tuesday. mr. ryan’s spokesman tersely responded that the speaker had never sought mr. trump’s endorsement, and ms. ayotte more or less brushed off the matter, saying, “i call it like i see it,” in reference to her defense of a fallen army captain whose family mr. trump had derided. while many republicans are hoping for ticket splitters     those who might vote democrat for president but republican on the rest of the ticket     the parsing is all the more difficult. many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. “in 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,” said fergus cullen, a former chairman of the new hampshire republican party. “it was not like passover, where the door was marked, ‘this one should be spared.’ no, the angel of death came in and said no ‘let’s kill them all.’ ” it is not just a question of individual desires to win       although that certainly drives many of the statements about mr. trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. republicans believe they need to maintain the house and the senate, through a   blend of votes from their base and   split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda. “the speaker’s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,” said kevin madden, a republican operative who once worked for former speaker john a. boehner. “the political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms. ” republican leaders also know that in an   election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the washington establishment. this was the lesson senator ted cruz of texas learned when he was booed from the stage at the republican convention last month for declining to get behind mr. trump, and accounts for some of the heat that senator ben sasse of nebraska, a founder of the never trump movement, has taken from his party back home this year. then, there is the vehement opposition to mrs. clinton, especially how they view her role in the benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among republicans. “i happen to think that lying to the american people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of donald trump,” said mr. chaffetz, the chairman of the house oversight committee. he added: “nothing united republicans more than hillary clinton. ” some still may pull away. on tuesday, representative richard hanna, republican of new york, said he would endorse mrs. clinton for president, calling mr. trump “unfit to serve. ” but mr. hanna is not representative of the broader republican conference. “he came to congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,” mr. gonzales said. “he would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek  . but since he’s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what’s on his mind. ” but if mr. trump falls in the polls and republicans running for   start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for   voters, mr. hanna might not be alone., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     paul d. ryan, the reluctant house speaker, eager 2012   nominee and youthful answer to hillary clinton, should be sprinting toward the republican convention, a bright, optimistic star poised to sell his party’s agenda. instead, mr. ryan finds himself essentially slouching toward cleveland, hampered in the house by restive republicans and emboldened democrats, and his spotlight taken by a nominee who has yet to fully earn his respect. mr. ryan’s fledgling speakership, which he once suggested would be one giant policy discussion, has instead been a series of extraordinary challenges. he has sought to be the voice of moral clarity for his party, even as republicans fracture over the divisive candidacy of donald j. trump. he has tried to ground himself in republican policy as the country’s political axis has shifted after terrorist attacks and gun violence, and has taken to more populist economic views. mr. ryan, the country’s   republican, seeks to maintain his stature in the party without alienating its trumpian factions or its   traditionalists. his most basic legislative agenda     getting a budget and spending bills passed     has failed, killed off by his right flank. he has been through a month of altercations with democrats over gun legislation, and now is forced to punish them for their   on the house floor. what would seem to be among his easier tasks     backing the presumptive republican presidential nominee     has become a bizarre ritual of alternately denouncing and then supporting mr. trump, on an almost weekly basis. an attempt to pass a modest bill aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring guns has been deeply resisted by many republicans, even though their senate counterparts want it. instead of sitting around poring over policy with committee chairmen, mr. ryan, 46, spends much of his day dealing with minor member issues, like complaints that he did not return messages quickly enough. mr. ryan grudgingly agreed to his speakership     for which he was drafted under protest     to give his party a sense of unity and stability. he now finds himself in the most chaotic climate his party has seen in more than a generation. “paul ryan has stepped into an enormously complicated situation,” said representative charlie dent of pennsylvania, who is one of the moderate house republicans who have distanced themselves from mr. trump. “the underlying dynamics that drove out john boehner remain,” mr. dent said of the former speaker. “now you have donald trump and all his rhetoric, and he knows most of his members want him to support trump while others like me want to keep their distance. then, not being able to pass a budget may be one of the greatest frustrations for the speaker. a lot of members don’t want anything to do with firearms or the budget. they want to cancel the session after the election. that is where we are. ” unlike mr. boehner, who went sailing into private life after being deposed by conservatives, mr. ryan continues to cheerfully promote the house agenda. he makes frequent television appearances and attends local media events at home in wisconsin. he will tell anyone who will listen about the conservative policy agenda he intends to pursue next year, in spite of the possibility that mrs. clinton might be in the white house. further, mr. trump has shown little interest in his priorities so far. “when the speaker took the job, he did it to help steady the ship at a difficult moment,” said brendan buck, a spokesman for mr. ryan. “he continues to try to be a stabilizing figure for the party and this place. ” also, unlike mr. boehner, mr. ryan remains largely popular with his fellow house republicans, who have appreciated his inclusive style. even among supporters of mr. trump, there is respect for mr. ryan’s consistency on core party issues. it is particularly rankling for mr. ryan, a former chairman of the house budget committee, that he is unable to pass a budget. the most conservative house republicans do not want to honor a deal struck by mr. boehner and the white house last year, which raised statutory budget caps to increase government spending. many have made it clear they will not vote for a budget with that higher spending level. this has made the appropriations process equally charged. but that is where mr. ryan has other problems. those bills have failed because of fights over  an amendment to bar federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, fights over the use of the confederate flag and other social issues. with republicans likely to lose seats in november, narrowing their large majority in the house, the most conservative members are likely to make up a larger, not small percentage of his conference after november. gerrymandered republican house districts, which produce very conservative members, and the probable sweeping out of moderate members in a presidential year combine to make it so. democrats, smelling blood but not well positioned to take back the house, have instead challenged mr. ryan. two weeks ago, a rattled mr. ryan looked out on the house floor, where he has spent much of his adult life, and saw hundreds of democrats, including many with whom he has served for years, shouting him down over gun control legislation. at 3 a. m. the heckles seemed to engulf the normally affable speaker as he struggled to call a vote on yet another bill that would go nowhere     this one helping to fight the zika virus. two weeks later, and the day after the death of five police officers in dallas, mr. ryan stared out at those same colleagues and begged for conciliation in a moving speech on the floor. “there will be a temptation to let our anger harden our divisions,” mr. ryan said friday. “let’s not let that happen. let’s defy those predictions. ” democrats, who had planned another set of protests that day, stood down. still, mr. ryan has vowed some form of punishment for their  . what happened on the house floor over the past few weeks “illustrated just how he is caught in the currents within his own party,” said representative sander m. levin, democrat of michigan, who served with mr. ryan on the ways and means committee and is close to him. “i was surprised by his comments that our gun protests were a political stunt when he knew better,” mr. levin said. “he knew people like john lewis and myself are not   people. his comment was contrary to the way he usually conducts himself. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(o’fallon, mo.     for much of the year, democrats viewed jason kander as a perfect senate candidate running in the wrong state. a charismatic former military intelligence officer and missouri’s current secretary of state, mr. kander, 35, faced an entrenched republican incumbent in a place where donald j. trump seemed destined to win. then mr. kander released a television ad last month in which he put an   assault rifle together blindfolded while reciting a script about gun rights, and started assailing his rival, senator roy d. blunt, on his lobbyist ties. suddenly, it was game on. mr. kander’s poll numbers soared. so did the panic among republicans trying to save mr. blunt, and possibly their senate majority. mr. kander’s ascent is the starkest demonstration of the volatile and at times confounding dynamics of the battle for control of the senate, with at least six races in a statistical dead heat just over two weeks before election day. surprisingly, democrats have improved their chances in places like missouri and north carolina, where they seemed to have no shot just six months ago, while they have all but given up in ohio and pulled their money out of florida, where prospects had seemed bright. republicans continue to cling to hope in new hampshire, nevada and pennsylvania, despite what looks like faltering support for mr. trump in those states. in several cases, individual state dynamics, candidate quality and a   spending spree have had as much to do with the shifting prospects as the top of the ticket. “with two weeks to go, control of the senate is up for grabs,” said nathan gonzales, editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report. “if republicans can break even in the tossup states, they have a chance to maintain control. but if the landscape shifts just a couple of points against republican candidates, democrats will capture the majority. ” in perhaps the oddest quirk of a decidedly erratic year, mr. kander may be benefiting from mr. trump’s   message. mr. blunt, who has served in congress since 1997 and whose family is chockablock with lobbyists, is the archetypal boogeyman mr. trump has attacked in his assault on washington insiders. mr. kander often finds trump and clinton supporters at his campaign events     people who fight among themselves, he said, even as they share support for him. “there are people who will choose to vote for donald trump because they want to shake up that conversation,” mr. kander said in an interview in st. louis. “they are not going to go to that next line on the ballot and vote for somebody who they know is exactly who donald trump is talking about. ” until 2004, missouri was an even more reliable presidential bellwether state than ohio. but growing homogeneity outside its larger cities has made it more reliably republican on the presidential level. still, it remains a state where voters have a tendency to pick democrats for other statewide offices. “the misconception about missouri is that it is a red state,” said ken warren, a professor of political science at st. louis university. “they don’t like democrats at the top of the ticket because they are seen as from out of town. but most of our statewide offices are held by democrats. ” it is a reality that mr. blunt seems to be just starting to confront, much to his party’s chagrin. “it’s a competitive race, like missouri races usually are,” he said in an interview at the local republican headquarters here, where he nibbled on a   bagel grabbed off a buffet, the sort of campaign sustenance typical of the exhausting final weeks on the road. “i’m confident of where we are. but not overly confident. ” as of   mr. blunt led mr. kander 46 percent to 44 percent, a    drop since august. democrats need to gain five seats to retake control of the senate     four if hillary clinton wins the presidency, which would give tim kaine, her vice president, a tiebreaking vote. both parties now, surprisingly, view missouri as a crucial state in that battle. “i’m the 51st vote,” mr. blunt warned a small group of female republican voters here on thursday, casting himself as the critical piece of a majority. “if mrs. clinton gets elected, the last place to have an impact on the court is the senate,” he said, referring to the united states supreme court. (it actually takes 60 votes to bring a supreme court nomination to the senate floor.) in an extremely costly year for senate races over all, missouri has become the     state, with $15 million in ads pouring into its race. two weeks after mr. kander’s   gun ad in september, political action committees and other outside groups dropped more than $8 million into the state on the two candidates, quadruple what they had spent in the previous two weeks, according to filings with the federal election commission. mr. kander has benefited from being a sui generis blend: at once, he is a   democrat, a veteran, a   lawyer who wears the outsider label, and the opponent of an incumbent who is the embodiment of washington longevity. he has focused on trying to turn mr. blunt’s experience into a liability. he has also homed in on the senator’s tangled family ties. mr. blunt’s wife is a lobbyist, and his three adult children are registered lobbyists as well. mr. kander’s ads and those of outside groups have suggested, among other things, that mr. blunt took votes to enrich industries that his family represented. for his part, mr. blunt and those groups supporting him have tried to cast mr. kander, who was a state representative before becoming secretary of state in 2013, as a toady for mrs. clinton and president obama, who are both unpopular here. one ad shows his face morphing into theirs with the tagline: “fresh face. same old liberal thinking. ” “senator blunt genuinely sees everything through the lens of partisan politics,” mr. kander said. (actually, mr. blunt is widely viewed as a consummate   in congress.) mr. kander’s military service is a boost, too, in a state with many veterans. mr. blunt’s draft deferments have also come up during the campaign, and he recently brought in another republican senator, joni ernst, who has served in the military, to support him at a veterans’ event. “  goes a long way here,” professor warren said. “superpatriotism is a big thing in missouri. ” missouri’s contest is indicative of the circumstances in many senate races. while mr. trump is weak in pennsylvania, for instance, the incumbent, senator patrick j. toomey, has managed to keep the race close by dint of his own record and a democratic candidate who has been less exciting than her party anticipated. at the same time, in a battle over an open seat in nevada, mr. trump has been a drag on the republican candidate, united states representative joe heck, not because mr. heck supports mr. trump but because his support for the republican nominee has waned. “in most cases trump is responsible” for republican weaknesses, said jennifer duffy, senior editor for the cook political report, “but there are quirky things going on. ” it is the sort of year that produces voters like michael brown, a vietnam veteran and conservative republican who came to a small   discussion last week with mr. kander in cape girardeau. mr. brown will not vote for mr. trump, he said, but remains undecided about the senate race. “this year is the toughest vote i’ve ever cast,” he said., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.406181\n",
      "(in one letter, donald j. trump ranted about the crisis of unsightly hot dog vendors on his beloved fifth avenue. “having ketchup and mustard splattered all over the sidewalk,” he wrote, “is disgraceful. ” in another note, he paid flowery tribute to his young wife, whom he referred to as “my little darling. ” “you’re everything i hoped for,” he wrote. in a different missive, he offered a rare admission of weakness, declaring, “i am nothing more than a frustrated writer of little talent. ” mr. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, is a master of modern media, exploiting twitter and television to punish his enemies, energize his allies and promote himself. but perhaps his most powerful and memorable form of communication is the   ritual of a personal letter, written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping, signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of trump tower. churned out prolifically from a   desk, they are letters of gratitude, hate, flattery and revenge, dispatched to teenage admirers and   mayors, professional athletes and magazine editors. the tone can range from florid to juvenile, pleading to poisonous. tightly clutched and prominently displayed even by those who despise him, the epistles have become keepsakes and mementos for hundreds of people across the country. viewed as a collection from the 1970s to now, they offer an unusual archive of his emotional ups and downs. the 2009 letter that mr. trump sent to mike tollin, a movie director, makes for painful reading: it denounced a film by mr. tollin that explored mr. trump’s role in the collapse of a football league as “third rate” and “extremely dishonest. ” in a fulminating flourish, mr. trump wrote: “p. s. you are a loser. ” nevertheless, mr. tollin had the letter framed and he keeps it on a shelf in his office, next to photographs of his family. “people come by and immediately want to see it, touch it and hold it,” mr. tollin said with pride. today, as mr. trump tries to make peace with hostile figures in his party, the candidate renowned for his rhetorical flame throwing is deploying a conciliatory style of letter writing as his chief weapon. his handwritten overtures have started to arrive in the mailboxes of seemingly implacable foes, like charlie sykes, a conservative radio host in milwaukee, who has described mr. trump as a “whiny,   bully. ” “charlie,” began mr. trump’s note, scribbled with a thick black pen on the front page of the new york times, next to an article about skeptical republicans warming to mr. trump, “i hope you can change your mind. ” ever attuned to incentives, the real estate mogul dangled an offer: “look forward to doing your show,” he wrote, adding, “i will win!” it did not change mr. sykes’s dim view of mr. trump. but he was, he conceded, impressed by the gesture. “give him credit that he’s doing this,” mr. sykes said. “he’s willing to do some things that might be somewhat at odds with his public image. ” the letters     culled from personal and public archives     reveal mr. trump’s insecurities, but also his perceptiveness about power, ego and what motivates people. from early on, he seemed to intuitively grasp the potency of his praise when lavished on   men. in the 1990s, mr. trump occasionally fawned over new york’s brash mayor, rudolph w. giuliani. in one letter, mr. trump tore out a page from a magazine interview in which he had called mr. giuliani “the greatest mayor that the city’s ever had. ” in case mr. giuliani missed the homage, mr. trump drew two bold arrows, each pointing at the glowing passage, and reiterated the message in a handwritten note: “rudy, you are the greatest!” he wrote, adding, “see you soon. ” there is never any question about authorship: mr. trump’s style of writing sounds virtually identical to his hyperbolic manner of speech, with a healthy sprinkling of the words “great” and “tremendous,” abundant displays of   and    claims of success or doom. in a 1985 letter to mayor edward i. koch, mr. trump predicted new york city’s imminent downfall if a fellow real estate developer, arthur e. imperatore sr. were allowed to start a ferry service between new jersey and manhattan. “real estate values and taxes in new york would plummet,” mr. trump prognosticated darkly. “why would anyone want to live or shop in new york?” (mr. imperatore started the ferry service without destroying new york’s economy.) as a writer, mr. trump sometimes reached, awkwardly but earnestly, for eloquence. in a 1983 letter to a. m. rosenthal, then the executive editor of the times and a lunch companion, mr. trump turned poetic as he tried to capture his reaction to an article that mr. rosenthal had written about returning to  poland for the first time in decades. “it is moving it is sad it is hopeful (?) it is devastating,” mr. trump wrote, saying that his wife at the time, ivana, who grew up in eastern europe, agreed. “it truly captured the strength, the will and the soul of the polish people,” mr. trump wrote. he could write with striking tenderness to ivana, according to notes reviewed by the times. “i adore and love my little darling,” he wrote to her in one. “i truly believe that you are the greatest,” he wrote in another. on the page, anyway, mr. trump was even capable of humility, describing himself as a scribe of “little talent” in a 1985 note to arthur ochs sulzberger, then the publisher of the times. (mr. trump had an agenda: to complain about a reporter he disliked.) mr. trump traces his epistolary habits to his attempt to win over franklin m. jarman, who controlled a manhattan department store that mr. trump wanted to buy in the 1970s to make way for trump tower. mr. jarman rarely replied to mr. trump’s letters, but he had, in fact, read them, mr. trump wrote in his book “the art of the deal,” laying the groundwork for an agreement. “the letters i wrote eventually did have an impact,” mr. trump said. for years, mr. trump sent his letters the   way, by mail. but over time, members of his staff dragged him into the internet era     sort of. he still writes by hand, brandishing the favored tool of teachers’ corrections and athletes’ autographs, a black sharpie. now his aides often turn the letters into digital files, scanning them and sending them by email. but he refuses to let anyone else do the writing. “if i had a secretary to do them,” he said in an interview, “they wouldn’t be nearly as effective, they wouldn’t be nearly as sharp. ” each letter concludes with his extravagant signature, which resembles a city skyline or “a seismograph,” as graydon carter, the editor of vanity fair and a repeat recipient of mr. trump’s screeds, described it. many of his letters targeted the famous and credentialed, but from time to time they reached the little known and uninfluential. mr. trump penned a letter of encouragement in 2014 to an    student in texas, john russell niederer, who had expressed a desire to meet him. “work hard and be smart,” mr. trump told him. the letter now hangs on mr. niederer’s bedroom wall. “for him to take the time to send a message to somebody like me,” he said, “was really, really cool. ” a vindictive side is never far from view in mr. trump’s correspondence. after the basketball legend kareem   wrote a critical essay in the washington post about mr. trump’s candidacy, mr. trump sent him a copy of the essay with a biting message sprawled across it. “now i know why the press always treated you so badly     they couldn’t stand you,” mr. trump wrote. “the fact is that you don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make america great again!” mr.   said he was flabbergasted. “it was such a petty and childish reaction, like a teenage boy responding to being turned down for a date by whining, ‘well, nobody likes you!’ ” he said. he likened mr. trump’s decision to write his reply on the original article to “a dog urinating on a tree to mark its territory. ” mr.   had to get rid of the letter. “i crumpled it up real nice and tight and skyhooked it into my wastepaper basket,” he recalled, invoking his trademark shot. others cannot let go. “i’m definitely going to keep it,” mr. sykes, the radio host, said of his letter. “probably in a desk drawer. ”, Michael Barbaro, 6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.402026\n",
      "(philadelphia     from the time donald j. trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional republicans treated his policy pronouncements     largely out of step with republican dogma     as essentially a distraction. he would talk. they would drive the policies. but now, the question of whether congressional republicans would change president trump or mr. trump would change them has an early answer. mr. trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in flint, mich. they also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that mr. trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5, 000 more border patrol agents. they have stayed oddly silent as mr. trump and senate democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from president barack obama. once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, republicans are now embracing mr. trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during mr. obama’s second term. speaker paul d. ryan, whose own website this week still praised the   partnership trade deal, now applauds mr. trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. many republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, mr. trump’s embrace of both. even on the subject of mr. trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, republicans have often demurred. “the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell of kentucky. mr. trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. “this congress is going to be the busiest congress we’ve had in decades, maybe ever,” mr. trump said. in an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, “we’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. you’re not wasting your time. ” many republicans in congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the obama administration’s decisions to halt the keystone xl and dakota access pipeline projects. “i think he’s completely winning the expectation game,” said representative peter roskam of illinois. “i think he’s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,” he said, adding, “it’s really remarkable. ” in one significant way, congressional republicans potentially seemed to pull mr. trump to their end of the policy pool. on thursday, the administration initially  appeared to endorse  taxing imports as a way to pay for the mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. but the white house later said it was just one option under consideration. “we are in a very good place on tax reform,” mr. ryan said. “it can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it’s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, i think most people agree that this is the right approach. ” congressional republicans are also struggling to keep up with mr. trump’s   announcements, let alone push their agenda. “it’s   stuff,” said senator john hoeven, republican of north dakota. investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see congress take on. “our priorities are the ones we laid out,” he said. they are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda     specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the affordable care act. “we are on the same page with the white house,” mr. ryan insisted thursday. “the president agrees with this agenda. ” but it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation. and the list is much longer. by contrast, last year, senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 senate republican, called democrats’ request for $600 million in aid to flint added to an energy bill “a huge earmark,” adding, “i think it’s not something i could support,” in keeping with most of his colleagues. republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight zika last year. the talk of a spending surge has left some republicans worried about an exploding deficit. “there are going to have to be some cuts,” said representative jason chaffetz of utah. “i am not interested in raising our spending levels. ” senator john barrasso of wyoming, the chairman of the environment and public works committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. “we’re a fiscally conservative group,” he said of the committee. “we’re going to want to see things paid for. ” republicans are also at times confused about what mr. trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on twitter. “‘appears’ i think is the big word,” said representative ryan costello of pennsylvania. “i don’t think anyone in the house of representatives on the republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,” only to have the trump administration send a bill back, he said. republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the house continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later. also notable is the republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised: the use of the executive pen to make policy. several house republicans dismissed the notion that mr. trump would abuse his power to issue executive orders in the way they complained that mr. obama did during his second term. “what you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,” said representative tom reed of new york. mr. trump is also trying to work his will on how the senate operates. in an interview with sean hannity on fox news, mr. trump said he thought mr. mcconnell should get rid of the senate filibuster rule for supreme court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick “obstructionists. ” about three blocks from where mr. trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from city hall to rally against the president. while the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. “i don’t trust anything he says,” said ken snyder, 62., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(york, pa.     senator patrick j. toomey, republican of pennsylvania, has never met charles kress, but he desperately needs him. mr. kress, 62, will vote for a democrat this november for the white house, he said, no matter what. he is also planning to vote for mr. toomey’s  . “sometimes you have to keep in office the ones who make the deals,” mr. kress said as he watered the flowers in front of york’s unitarian church. republican senators like mr. toomey who are running in swing states     about six, and enough to tip the balance of power in the senate     need voters who would reject donald j. trump to nonetheless pull the levers for the party’s other candidates in november. in some districts, house republicans will need them, too. mr. trump’s convincing sweep of the primaries in connecticut, delaware, maryland, pennsylvania and rhode island on tuesday did little to assuage concerns about his standing with swing voters in november. his victory speech included a bracing broadside against hillary clinton’s playing the “woman card. ” and he continues to trail his opponents, senator ted cruz of texas and gov. john kasich of ohio, among republican women. but   voters in federal races have become increasingly rare over the last two decades, hitting a low in 2012, when only 10 percent of them divided their votes between parties. that was down sharply from 1972. the ranks of   voters have expanded along with the rise in partisanship and its attendant rancor in congress. “there is no doubt that, over all, the era of polarization and   above and beyond idiosyncratic factors     that has to lead to a drop in ticket splitting,” said richard born, a professor of political science at vassar college and an expert on congressional elections. “democrats and republicans alike, as part of the polarization phenomenon, are more consistently liberal or conservative across issues,” mr. born said, “as are the candidates themselves, meaning less likelihood of ticket splitting. ” even in pennsylvania, a state that has elected a senator from a different party than the presidential candidate it chose seven times since world war ii, ticket splitting has decreased drastically in recent elections. “that is probably toomey’s worst problem,” said g. terry madonna, the director of the center for politics and public affairs at franklin and marshall college. it is also a problem for the republican senators kelly ayotte of new hampshire, ron johnson of wisconsin, mark s. kirk of illinois and rob portman of ohio. republicans in washington are increasingly worried for them. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader, and other republicans are openly urging elected officials in their party to focus largely on local issues and their role in bipartisan legislation, and to refrain from tying themselves to the top of the ticket should the nominee be mr. trump. “i think we have to go out and make a case,” said representative scott perry, a republican who represents the york area. “people don’t split their tickets because they don’t have a choice. it’s because they do. i think those people are going to need to be convinced. ” while a polarizing presidential candidate is considered very difficult for republican senators to overcome in swing states, there may be a silver lining for them. some republican donors are quietly plotting to dismiss mr. trump and instead pour their money into senate races where they believe republicans can be saved, as a check and balance to a democrat sitting in the white house for the next four years. “the prospect of trump at the top of the ticket could create an exodus of donors away from the presidential and toward senate and house races,” said kevin madden, a republican strategist. “the potential is there for a concentration of effort and resources geared toward senate races that chuck schumer and his senate democrats may not have been counting on. ” mr. schumer, a new yorker who is poised to become the next leader of the senate democrats, says good luck with that. “if there was ever a national election, this is it,” he said. “they can run from their nominee, but they can’t hide. ” ticket splitting over the last five decades has occurred most often among moderate democrats who have supported a republican for president but voted for democrats for congress. some voters have viewed this as a recipe for compromise and balance, while others have been repelled by the democratic candidates running for the top job. the three strongest years of ticket splitting between presidential and house voting in the last five decades, according to american national election studies survey data, were 1972, when 30 percent of voters did it 1980 (28 percent) and 1984 (26 percent). similar studies show the same trend for senate races. in all three of those elections, a republican won the white house by a landslide at a time when registered democrats significantly outnumbered republicans in the overall population, and when considerably more incumbent house members were democrats. the 1928 election provides a history lesson in what can happen when a candidate, rather than the political mood, drives ticket splitting. that year, al smith, the governor of new york, became the democratic nominee. it was not extreme rhetoric like mr. trump engages in, which has repelled some republicans, that held mr. smith back with voters. mr. smith was a roman catholic, opposed prohibition and was a symbol of modern urbanism. and that combination drove off rural and moderate southern democrats, who outnumbered republicans significantly, contributing to his loss to the republican herbert hoover. while republicans made a net gain of eight seats in the senate that year, demonstrating that ticket splitting does not help all senators attached to the party of a wildly unpopular candidate, many democrats still voted along party lines for the house and senate. in 1996, when it was clear that bill clinton would trounce bob dole, republicans encouraged voters to stick with their party in the down ballot, and newt gingrich, then speaker of the house, cautioned his members to distance themselves from mr. dole. mr. gingrich came up with a parallel house agenda much as speaker paul d. ryan is now doing, and he told members to run on it. “it saved the house and the senate for them,” said mr. born, the vassar professor. “trying to localize the campaigns paid off. ” but republican ticket splitters may make an alternative choice that is equally damaging to mr. toomey’s prospects. “i might just skip the whole thing,” said kristi peyton, 46, a toomey fan who offered her views of mr. trump     “disaster,” “bully” and “unattractive”     over crabs at captain bob’s in railroad, a small town near york. “where republicans can really get hurt is not so much that people vote democrat for congress but that they don’t show up at all,” mr. born said. “this is where the republicans are scared to death. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(tucson, ariz.     senator john mccain does not say much these days about donald j. trump’s attack on his   years as a prisoner of war. instead, he clenches his teeth and says he will support the republican party’s presumptive nominee, who once said derisively about the senator’s time in captivity, “i like people that weren’t captured. ” in the   swelter here in arizona, his home state, mr. mccain, who was the republicans’ presidential nominee and   in 2008, did not openly bemoan this moment from his long political life. he is focusing on what he considers his toughest   fight yet, and is betting that the only way to keep his seat is to support mr. trump. “i’m fair game. i’m in the arena,” said mr. mccain, 79, whose thinning face reflects the decades he has spent traveling around his massive and increasingly diverse state. still, the episode sits with traces of bitterness, like old coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup, even if he says otherwise. for a moment, the july attack on mr. mccain seemed to be mr. trump’s undoing. mccain said he recalled a recent chat with a world war ii veteran who had been in a german prison camp. as he delivered the man a missing medal, “he said to me, ‘why would trump say something like that about us?’ ” the senator said. “frankly, i didn’t have an answer for it. ” but mr. trump has since called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a wall at the mexican border, and now the billionaire businessman could be the force that ultimately topples the indomitable mr. mccain. an estimated 433, 000 hispanics are expected to vote in arizona this november, an 8 percent increase from 2012. and mr. mccain has a credible democratic challenger, representative ann kirkpatrick, who grew up on an indian reservation and has strong support from the state’s sizable native american population. “i just came from a latino round table, and they are really concerned about mccain’s support for trump,” she said tuesday. “it’s very personal here. ” she is working with the state’s democrats to harness these forces against mr. mccain and his old guard, which is largely behind mr. trump. ms. kirkpatrick said that being   “is a strong message,” but she acknowledged that “it’s not the only message. ” she recently opened a field office in tempe, and has many arizona state university volunteers working the phones. working out of an old bank, aides sit in the former vault (the door has been removed) to go over mr. mccain’s statements, year by year, and look for inconsistencies that suggest too long a stay in congress. “the race comes down to whether arizonans take a step back and judge john mccain for being john mccain and his remarkable life of public service,” said grant woods, a former state attorney general and the senator’s friend for decades. “and not as being a   incumbent, and not as a republican in a year when the party has a controversial nominee. if they do that, he will win walking away. if they don’t, then it could be tight. could he lose? yeah. ” despite the personal attacks by mr. trump on the senator’s integrity and war record, mr. mccain cannot afford to reject mr. trump and alienate his many supporters in arizona if he hopes to hold his seat, an agonizing  . mr. mccain is the embodiment of much that voters in both parties, but especially fans of mr. trump, have said they would like to jettison this year. he is the ultimate establishment player, having served in congress for nearly four decades     five terms in the senate alone. “back in the middle ages, i was known as the maverick,” mr. mccain said, smiling wanly. he is an unapologetic free trader, an interventionist abroad who continues to defend the deeply unpopular war in iraq, a supporter of private industry and markets, and the original, if inconstant, champion of changes to the immigration system that would help some illegal immigrants become citizens. to succeed in what most people believe will be his last political campaign, mr. mccain must canter around the state assuring mr. trump’s detractors that he does not share the businessman’s visions for mass deportation and the dissolution of nato, while continuing to woo an angry republican base that overwhelmingly voted for mr. trump in the state’s march primary. “i’ve been feeling it out there for some time,” mr. mccain said. “in the southern part of the state here, they are not feeling the recovery at all. then there is this whole issue with these young people and kids carrying around all this debt. ” “that’s the bernie effect,” he said, referring to senator bernie sanders’s youth appeal in the democratic primaries. he added: “the turmoil in this race is more than i’ve ever seen. younger, newer voters are registering for only one reason, to vote against trump. so my challenge is to convince that younger, newer voter that i am for them. ” his greater challenge may be with latinos angry at mr. trump. according to an analysis of voter and census data by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials educational fund, latinos are expected to account for 17 percent of arizona’s registered electorate this year, with a voter turnout rate at close to 70 percent. nearly 45 percent of latino registered voters are democrats, the report found. “i’ve always spent a lot of time with the hispanic community,” mr. mccain said, “but having said that, they are rising in numbers in the voting population. i’m putting more emphasis there, particularly in light of trump’s comments. ” hispanics in the phoenix area will also be heavily motivated to vote in the sheriff’s election joe arpaio, a trump supporter who was recently found in contempt of court for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining latinos, will be on the ballot, trying to keep his seat as maricopa county sheriff. a day watching mr. mccain campaign here this past week reflects his evolving challenges. he sat for the endorsement of a small group of border patrol agents, who have also endorsed mr. trump, and listened in silence as art del cueto, the president of tucson local 2455 of the national border patrol council, explained why mr. trump had gotten their approval. “it means so much to me this long relationship we’ve had,” mr. mccain said about his endorsement, “and the support we’ve tried to provide. ” mr. del cueto did say that “we did talk to donald” about his comments concerning mr. mccain’s war record. “i don’t think it was a comment that has been made again,” he said. but a bit later, meeting with hispanic business leaders, mr. mccain opened with “we’re going to make america great again and it’s going to be huge, o. k.?” it was a tiny swipe at mr. trump, taken in the manner of a toddler grabbing a cookie when he assumes no one is looking. then it was on to other topics, like the federal aviation administration reauthorization. mr. mccain remains most at home with other veterans, like the one he visited     on memorial day, another man waiting on medals. “his wife said he was staying alive to get those medals,” mr. mccain said, smiling at the memory. “sometimes it’s a nice job. ”,

      "(a look at the political math in six states where tight races could determine control of the senate: north carolina senator richard burr, a republican, was thought to be a safe bet for   against deborah ross, his democratic challenger, who is a former state representative and head of the state’s chapter of the american civil liberties union. but north carolina has been roiled by a fight over bathroom rights for transgender people that has affected almost every campaign. the national republican party has swooped in to try to save mr. burr’s bid. _____ pennsylvania  katie mcginty, a democrat, is trying to become pennsylvania’s first female senator with a bid to unseat senator patrick j. toomey, a republican who has managed to keep a moderate image around the state because of a (failed) gun safety bill that bore his name. hillary clinton’s coattails     and donald j. trump’s anvil     have made a difference here. _____ new hampshire  senator kelly ayotte, a republican, is suffering from an uncomfortable association with mr. trump, most notably when she had to release a statement walking back her suggestion during a debate that mr. trump was a role model for children. gov. maggie hassan, her democratic challenger, is getting major assistance from national party figures like vice president joseph r. biden jr. and senator bernie sanders in what is widely viewed as the closest senate race in the country. _____ missouri senator roy d. blunt was on no lists of endangered incumbents. then his democratic challenger, jason kander, an afghanistan veteran who is missouri’s secretary of state, conjured up an ad in which he assembled an assault rifle blindfolded while speaking of gun rights. it was a clever way to both fend off attacks over gun control and underscore mr. blunt’s vietnam deferments in a very   state. mr. blunt’s decades of service in washington are also out of style this year. _____ indiana  evan bayh, a democrat, is trying to reclaim his senate seat but is finding that his time as a washington insider is a serious liability. representative todd young, with the help of millions of dollars in outside money, is painting a dark picture of mr. bayh as a greedy lobbyist who abandoned his voters, and mr. bayh’s   lead has shrunk significantly. indiana is trump country, and mr. bayh, who was once a very popular governor, is going to need republican voters who remember him fondly to split their tickets. _____ nevada for a while, it did not seem that catherine cortez masto, a democrat who is a former state attorney general, would catch up to representative joe heck, a republican who seemed a good fit for his state and this cycle. but mr. heck, by turning away from mr. trump after the presidential candidate was heard bragging about sexual assault in a 2005 recording, began to lose some of his base support, living every republican candidate’s nightmare. the hispanic vote, important here, is hard to poll. but ms. cortez masto is now narrowly ahead in the race, a battle for the seat of senator harry reid in which the retiring democratic leader has unleashed his political machine in support of her., Jennifer

      "(washington     the most powerful and ambitious   congress in 20 years will convene tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of american life     refashioning the country’s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the obama administration. even before   donald j. trump is sworn in on jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities     most notably a measure to clear a path for the affordable care act’s repeal. perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new congress is the push for deregulation. also up early: filling a   supreme court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for mr. trump’s cabinet nominees. “it’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,” said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader. “and we intend to do it. ” but as republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of congress for their more partisan goals, democrats are preparing roadblocks. the party’s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of russian election interference, mr. trump’s   cabinet picks and his taunting twitter posts. (on saturday, he offered new year’s wishes “to all,” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. ”) obstacles will also come from republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. and any burst of legislative action will come only if congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. for republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved     the house in particular has signaled the republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. but many of those measures have gathered dust in the senate or been doused in veto ink. the cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent house republican majority in the  . speaker newt gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the senate majority leader, bob dole, who stacked conservative house bills like so many fire logs in the back of the senate chamber. “they’ve been given a golden opportunity here,” said trent lott, the former republican senate majority leader. “but i have watched over the years when one party has had control of the white house and the senate and the house, and the danger is overplaying your hand. “if you go too far, like what happened with obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,” mr. lott continued. “you have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ” the tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the senate finance committee is already moving in that direction. still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from mr. trump’s chief of staff, reince priebus. the senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for mr. trump. republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. but on many issues, senate democrats     including their new leader, chuck schumer of new york     are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of mr. trump’s agenda. “after campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   trump’s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he’s sworn in,” said senator patty murray, democrat of washington. “democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ” republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that president obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the trump team on which ones should be undone. “i hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,” the house speaker, paul d. ryan of wisconsin, said at a recent forum. “i think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ” in late december, the obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. that regulation, one of dozens that mr. trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. but congress is likely to block it, using the obscure congressional review act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion. given time constraints on the senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. they are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. republicans will also move quickly to repeal the affordable care act. they plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year     already a quarter over     that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any democratic filibuster. but republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace mr. obama’s, and they may delay the repeal measure’s effective date for years. the senate must also consider mr. trump’s cabinet picks, and senate democrats are already trying to slow the process. however, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than supreme court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with mr. trump’s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. republicans have been particularly upset that senator jeff sessions of alabama, whom mr. trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with democrats on the senate judiciary committee or had meetings canceled. senator dianne feinstein of california postponed her meeting with mr. sessions until january because, she said, her schedule got too busy. “the senator doesn’t want to rush,” said her spokesman, tom mentzer. one reason that democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over mr. mcconnell’s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the supreme court nomination of judge merrick b. garland. lingering in the background is the specter of russia. democrats     and some republicans, who are at odds with mr. trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him     want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. the obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. while republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. “this is no time for hubris,” mr. mcconnell said. “you have to perform. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

(pichai said tuesday google’s   knowledge graph is loaded with a growing library of 70 billion   facts.) now it’s focusing that expertise on ai that will be with   you no matter where you are. your home. your car. your phone. and   soon, everywhere else. ’ ’   the ai assistant race is the next major battle in personal   computing, and assistant is the first step towards that       computer. it already wipes the   floor with the competition, and it’s tough to see how anyone else   can keep up. ’, Steve Kovach, 8)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.313780\n",

fact, the parallels between twitter and yahoo are rather   striking: ’ ’   a rotating cast of ceos and executives with little   direction; a powerful platform once seen as the future of the   internet struggling with an identity crisis; questionable   strategies for growth. ’ ”   if it doesn’t sell soon, twitter risks setting itself up for   yahoo’s same fate: a   stagnation in which no   progress is made, and company focus and morale are slowly   drained by   takeover talks. the story ends   with a desperate sale for a tiny fraction of its peak   valuation. ” ”   right now, twitter seems to think it can fetch as much as   $30 billion in a sale, about double its market cap as of friday,   . yahoo,    agreed to sell to verizon for $4. 8 billion this year. that was   8 years after microsoft offered to buy yahoo for $42   billion     an offer that yahoo’s leadership stubbornly   rebuffed.  ” ”   if ceo jack dorsey and the twitter board pull a yahoo from 2008,   they’re setting themselves up for a . ” ”   twitter would also be taking a gamble if it doesn’t sell and   tries to make it on its own. as  one option the company is   considering other than a sale is a restructuring that could   include layoffs. but we’ve seen twitter go through that before,   and it hasn’t helped solve its user growth problems. as the   saying goes     and as yahoo proved through many rounds of layoffs   and endless restructurings     you can’t cut your way to   growth. ” ’  ’ ”   despite its many problems, twitter is still an attractive asset.   it’s an invaluable tool for news gatherers, celebrities, world   leaders, activists and marketers. it has a treasure trove of   untapped data, which probably looks pretty tasty to companies   like google and salesforce. twitter was the platform that a   reality tv    tycoon used to promote himself all   the way to the gop nomination for the presidency. no one can deny   the power and influence twitter wields, even with   its relatively small base of active users.  ” ”   but twitter’s company culture has always prided itself on being   fiercely independent. the company turned down an offer from   facebook in its early days. ” ”   and while cofounder dorsey doesn’t control a majority of   twitter’s voting shares (as facebook’s mark zuckerberg and   google’s larry page and sergey brin do) it’s not clear how   amenable dorsey might be to selling out     or how vigorously he   might try to oppose a deal. ” ”   depending on who the buyer is, an acquisition might not be at   odds with twitter’s mission. unlike yahoo, which seems   destined to be   for valuable resources and left   unrecognizable once verizon gains jurisdiction over it, twitter’s   service could actually flourish under a parent company that   provides additional resources and leeway.  ” ’  ’ ’     ’, Steve Kovach, 8)

      "( (cnn) us intelligence agencies released on friday an alarming report about a hostile foreign country’s efforts to subvert america’s system of government, and the incoming president does not seem to understand the danger of the situation. in a   document, the country’s top intelligence experts declared that russian president vladimir putin ordered a campaign to influence the us presidential election. ”russia’s goals,” they concluded, ”were to undermine public faith in the us democratic process, denigrate secretary clinton, and harm her electability.”  this is an extraordinary accusation, and the intelligence chiefs are fully aware of that. it is not a     spying operation: it was a plot aimed at corroding the foundation of america’s system of government and    as the report puts it    upending ”the   liberal democratic order.” that means that russia’s objectives, despite trump’s victory, have not been fully achieved.   if that were not enough reason for alarm, trump’s reaction shows he either doesn’t comprehend the seriousness of the matter, he does not care or, perhaps, as some have suggested, he’s not committed to america’s democracy. in fact, it seems that the   is only able to view the issue through his  . somehow, he cannot look beyond the impact this has on his image as the winner of the election. that   view is in sharp contrast with republicans (and democrats) in congress who have managed to rise above partisanship to face up to what has just happened. while republican sen. john mccain called russia’s actions  ”an act of war,” and house speaker paul ryan, also a republican, acknowledged  that russia ”clearly tried to meddle in our political system,” trump is caught in his solipsistic house of mirrors.  just before receiving a classified briefing on the intelligence, the   gave a telephone interview to the new york times in which he belittled the significance what occurred and called the commotion surrounding the findings of russia’s hacking and other activities a political witch hunt by democrats embarrassed by their election loss.  after he was briefed by the intelligence chiefs, he accepted the possibility of a russian hack, but grudgingly and with no appearance that he grasped the magnitude and significance of what occurred. he released a statement saying he and the intelligence briefers had a ”constructive meeting,” but his statement’s principal thrust was the claim that, ”there was absolutely no effect on the [election] outcome whatsoever,” and no tampering with voting machines. huh? clearly, trump misses the point. this is not about him it is about protecting the country he has been elected to govern from an active and deliberate threat. in his statement, trump vowed to get tough on hacking from various countries, but did not indicate he viewed russia as the culprit in the election interference operation. the russian interference campaign, as it happens, was not just hacking, even if actions by russian and   hackers played a major part in the operation. russia’s activities    which we have seen targeting other western democracies    included a vast array of techniques.  hacking the democratic national committee and clinton campaign chief john podesta’s emails were important elements of the russian efforts. the report shows how the hack was carried out and how the documents were handed to wikileaks for dissemination. ”moscow’s influence campaign,” as the intelligence report calls it, blended a variety of means, including covert cyberactivity by russian intelligence operatives, along with ”with overt   media,   intermediaries, and paid social media users or ’trolls’.”  and there was trump himself, who peddled the material to his followers, making it sound as if the hacks contained truly explosive information.  all those clinton emails, in fact, were the least of it. few people read them, but many people believed the claim that they contained great and horrifying secrets.   the greater effort was in painting clinton as unfit to lead. putin, as we wrote months ago and as us intelligence experts concluded, ”developed a clear preference” for trump over clinton. when he thought clinton would win despite russia’s multipronged effort to cast doubt on her, the plan shifted to undercutting the credibility of the election.  the report says   government bloggers were all set to launch a #democracyrip campaign after a clinton win, to undercut the election’s credibility. curiously, trump had also strongly suggested that if he lost it would be because of fraud. putin made a big push to help trump win. he deployed his ”news” agencies, rt and sputnik, along with a vast social media machine to promote false accusations that clinton was corrupt, ill, mentally unstable and linked to islamist groups. as it happens, trump did the same, promoting precisely that unfounded description of his rival, all the way to electoral victory.  the looming question is what, if anything, trump will do to stop this russian assault on democracy. will he carry on his plan to repair relations with the kremlin without taking any action? will he lift the modest sanctions just imposed by president barack obama? trump concluded his statement today saying, ”america’s safety and security will be my number one priority.” what is not clear is whether american democracy is also a priority. the   is playing a risky game by downplaying this matter and resisting the intelligence community’s conclusions. even before he takes office, the issue has already opened a rift with fellow republicans, and it has raised piercing questions that he cannot afford to ignore.  as democratic whip steny hoyer said, trump’s continued  denial of russia’s intervention in the election, ”would raise questions about where his sympathies truly lie.”, Frida Ghitis, 2)    0.113943\n",
      "( (cnn) though donald trump and vladimir putin seem to agree on a number of issues, there is one they apparently don’t see eye to eye on. while trump argues that hillary clinton is too weak to be president of the united states, the russian president appears to be genuinely afraid of clinton. evidence is growing that russia is actively working to undermine clinton’s presidential prospects. when hackers released the emails of the democratic national committee just hours before the democratic national convention, internet security specialists found the fingerprints of russian agencies. then came the latest hacks of clinton campaign chairman john podesta.  the us government has now formally accused russia of interfering in the us elections, and every instance of interference so far is clearly aimed at harming the democratic candidate.  it’s easy to see why putin fears clinton. while the trump campaign is trying to get voters to focus on clinton stumbling and coughing, putin sees her as a real threat to his objectives. for putin, stopping clinton is not only an important strategic goal. it is also personal.  back in 2011, putin faced the biggest protests the country had seen since the collapse of the soviet union. he had served two terms as president, the maximum allowed, and in 2008 had become prime minister, in a maneuver that allowed him to effectively hold power while his ally, dmitry medvedev, was president. then he announced    to much anger, but little surprise    that he would seek a third term as president. three months later, the opposition erupted in fury when his party won a landslide victory in legislative elections amid allegations of fraud. despite the frigid moscow temperatures, thousands massed in the streets calling for fair elections and for an end to putin’s seemingly endless rule. signs and chants declared, ”putin is a thief!” putin’s hold on power faced a genuine threat.   of state clinton openly sided with the protesters. ”the russian people, like people everywhere,” she said, ”. ..deserve free, fair, transparent elections.” putin was fuming. he blamed the protests on clinton, accusing her of sending ”a signal” to the opposition. putin’s personal animosity toward clinton coincides with his larger strategic goals. in recent years, he has launched an increasingly muscular foreign (and domestic) policy. he is challenging the us, nato and the european union at every turn. despite a shrinking economy    not much bigger than mexico’s    russia has used its military power to make it a major player on the global stage. russia, according to western analysts, has mounted a campaign to ”discredit the west’s liberal democratic model, and undermine   ties,” manipulating eastern european countries and ”supporting the far right” against the eu. that ”kremlin playbook” includes tampering with elections in europe and the us. clinton stands in direct defiance to putin’s vision, already partly in place, of a russia with a sphere of influence that includes the former soviet territory and, more loosely, eastern europe, alongside a weakened europe, us and nato. in contrast to trump, she has made countless comments over the years to suggest she would present a much tougher opponent to putin’s ambitions than barack obama has been, saying she thinks the united states must find ways to ”confine, contain, [and] deter russian aggression in europe and beyond.”  while clinton looks poised to toughen america’s stance, trump’s foreign policy coincides with russia’s. he has suggested he might recognize russia’s annexation of crimea, which putin captured by force from ukraine he might suspend economic sanctions against russia and would align his policies in syria with putin and assad. during the republican primaries, clinton came under fire for leading the obama administration’s failed diplomatic ”reset” with russia. but the former us ambassador to moscow, mike mcfaul, said she was deeply skeptical that the plan would bear fruit.  once out of office, her criticism of russia became cutting. when putin justified russia’s 2014 takeover of crimea as an effort to protect russian minorities there, clinton said it was reminiscent of hitler’s justification for taking over parts of eastern europe. putin later commented that clinton has ”never been too graceful in her statements.” clinton was implicitly critical of obama’s restrained response, saying, ”i am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of crimea and the continuing destabilization of ukraine.”  and just as putin targeted her by name, she, too, has gone after him personally. in a speech last year, she said, ”i remain convinced that we need a concerted effort to really up the costs on russia and in particular on putin.” the most urgent item on the foreign policy agenda for both the united states and russia is the civil war in syria. there, the trump campaign has offered conflicting ideas, but in the most recent debate trump seemed to stand with putin.  while obama has maintained an extremely restrained approach to the crisis, sending secretary of state john kerry to multiple, so far useless, diplomatic marathons with his russian counterpart even as russia continues bombing civilians in support of assad, clinton sounds determined to impose a   zone, which would defy not only syria’s army but also russia. she says she would keep the russians informed, so no clashes occur, adding ”i want them at the table,” but it is a sharp departure from the current policy, and one that must sound deeply disturbing to putin. a few years ago, putin mused, speaking about clinton, that ”it’s better not to argue with women.” it’s clear now why he’s going to great lengths to avoid having to argue with a president hillary clinton.   , Frida Ghitis, 2)       0.107810\n",

      "(washington     when donald j. trump goes low, congressional republicans go quiet. their tolerance of mr. trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for  . but on one point, all sides agree: they have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. and mr. trump’s provocations are making the republicans’ control of the senate, perhaps even the house, more tenuous. many republicans, even those whose contempt for mr. trump matches their ill will for president obama, still view the choice between mr. trump and hillary clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. they believe that mr. trump, guided by a   congress, will break their way more than mrs. clinton ever would. for others, the vacancy on the supreme court     and its potential to reshape the high court’s rulings for years     overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee’s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts. “the supreme court is probably the choice that will have the single most   effect on the nation,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, where mr. trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly republican state. congressional republicans who are up for       especially the handful like senators john mccain of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire who still face primaries     have made a basic calculation. they have criticized mr. trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. and party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and mr. trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities. alienating mr. trump’s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. their fears at this point appear justified. a poll conducted the last week of july by cbs news found that support for mr. trump among republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent. so the leaders largely responded to mr. trump’s attacks with feigned indifference. “republican elected officials are in a tough spot,” said nathan l. gonzales, the editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report, a nonpartisan newsletter. “they are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. some republicans are reluctant to attack donald trump because they’d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries. ” mr. trump pointedly declined on tuesday to endorse speaker paul d. ryan, the nation’s   elected republican, and verged on outright opposition to mr. mccain and ms. ayotte, just hours after mr. obama challenged republicans to denounce their nominee. both mr. obama and mr. trump have put republicans into an untenable position: criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for       but sitting idly as mr. trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters. “if you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?” mr. obama asked during a news conference on tuesday. mr. ryan’s spokesman tersely responded that the speaker had never sought mr. trump’s endorsement, and ms. ayotte more or less brushed off the matter, saying, “i call it like i see it,” in reference to her defense of a fallen army captain whose family mr. trump had derided. while many republicans are hoping for ticket splitters     those who might vote democrat for president but republican on the rest of the ticket     the parsing is all the more difficult. many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. “in 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,” said fergus cullen, a former chairman of the new hampshire republican party. “it was not like passover, where the door was marked, ‘this one should be spared.’ no, the angel of death came in and said no ‘let’s kill them all.’ ” it is not just a question of individual desires to win       although that certainly drives many of the statements about mr. trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. republicans believe they need to maintain the house and the senate, through a   blend of votes from their base and   split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda. “the speaker’s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,” said kevin madden, a republican operative who once worked for former speaker john a. boehner. “the political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms. ” republican leaders also know that in an   election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the washington establishment. this was the lesson senator ted cruz of texas learned when he was booed from the stage at the republican convention last month for declining to get behind mr. trump, and accounts for some of the heat that senator ben sasse of nebraska, a founder of the never trump movement, has taken from his party back home this year. then, there is the vehement opposition to mrs. clinton, especially how they view her role in the benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among republicans. “i happen to think that lying to the american people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of donald trump,” said mr. chaffetz, the chairman of the house oversight committee. he added: “nothing united republicans more than hillary clinton. ” some still may pull away. on tuesday, representative richard hanna, republican of new york, said he would endorse mrs. clinton for president, calling mr. trump “unfit to serve. ” but mr. hanna is not representative of the broader republican conference. “he came to congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,” mr. gonzales said. “he would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek  . but since he’s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what’s on his mind. ” but if mr. trump falls in the polls and republicans running for   start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for   voters, mr. hanna might not be alone., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(philadelphia     from the time donald j. trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional republicans treated his policy pronouncements     largely out of step with republican dogma     as essentially a distraction. he would talk. they would drive the policies. but now, the question of whether congressional republicans would change president trump or mr. trump would change them has an early answer. mr. trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in flint, mich. they also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that mr. trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5, 000 more border patrol agents. they have stayed oddly silent as mr. trump and senate democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from president barack obama. once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, republicans are now embracing mr. trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during mr. obama’s second term. speaker paul d. ryan, whose own website this week still praised the   partnership trade deal, now applauds mr. trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. many republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, mr. trump’s embrace of both. even on the subject of mr. trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, republicans have often demurred. “the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell of kentucky. mr. trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. “this congress is going to be the busiest congress we’ve had in decades, maybe ever,” mr. trump said. in an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, “we’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. you’re not wasting your time. ” many republicans in congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the obama administration’s decisions to halt the keystone xl and dakota access pipeline projects. “i think he’s completely winning the expectation game,” said representative peter roskam of illinois. “i think he’s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,” he said, adding, “it’s really remarkable. ” in one significant way, congressional republicans potentially seemed to pull mr. trump to their end of the policy pool. on thursday, the administration initially  appeared to endorse  taxing imports as a way to pay for the mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. but the white house later said it was just one option under consideration. “we are in a very good place on tax reform,” mr. ryan said. “it can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it’s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, i think most people agree that this is the right approach. ” congressional republicans are also struggling to keep up with mr. trump’s   announcements, let alone push their agenda. “it’s   stuff,” said senator john hoeven, republican of north dakota. investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see congress take on. “our priorities are the ones we laid out,” he said. they are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda     specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the affordable care act. “we are on the same page with the white house,” mr. ryan insisted thursday. “the president agrees with this agenda. ” but it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation. and the list is much longer. by contrast, last year, senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 senate republican, called democrats’ request for $600 million in aid to flint added to an energy bill “a huge earmark,” adding, “i think it’s not something i could support,” in keeping with most of his colleagues. republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight zika last year. the talk of a spending surge has left some republicans worried about an exploding deficit. “there are going to have to be some cuts,” said representative jason chaffetz of utah. “i am not interested in raising our spending levels. ” senator john barrasso of wyoming, the chairman of the environment and public works committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. “we’re a fiscally conservative group,” he said of the committee. “we’re going to want to see things paid for. ” republicans are also at times confused about what mr. trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on twitter. “‘appears’ i think is the big word,” said representative ryan costello of pennsylvania. “i don’t think anyone in the house of representatives on the republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,” only to have the trump administration send a bill back, he said. republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the house continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later. also notable is the republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised: the use of the executive pen to make policy. several house republicans dismissed the notion that mr. trump would abuse his power to issue executive orders in the way they complained that mr. obama did during his second term. “what you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,” said representative tom reed of new york. mr. trump is also trying to work his will on how the senate operates. in an interview with sean hannity on fox news, mr. trump said he thought mr. mcconnell should get rid of the senate filibuster rule for supreme court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick “obstructionists. ” about three blocks from where mr. trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from city hall to rally against the president. while the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. “i don’t trust anything he says,” said ken snyder, 62., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     the most powerful and ambitious   congress in 20 years will convene tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of american life     refashioning the country’s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the obama administration. even before   donald j. trump is sworn in on jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities     most notably a measure to clear a path for the affordable care act’s repeal. perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new congress is the push for deregulation. also up early: filling a   supreme court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for mr. trump’s cabinet nominees. “it’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,” said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader. “and we intend to do it. ” but as republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of congress for their more partisan goals, democrats are preparing roadblocks. the party’s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of russian election interference, mr. trump’s   cabinet picks and his taunting twitter posts. (on saturday, he offered new year’s wishes “to all,” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. ”) obstacles will also come from republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. and any burst of legislative action will come only if congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. for republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved     the house in particular has signaled the republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. but many of those measures have gathered dust in the senate or been doused in veto ink. the cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent house republican majority in the  . speaker newt gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the senate majority leader, bob dole, who stacked conservative house bills like so many fire logs in the back of the senate chamber. “they’ve been given a golden opportunity here,” said trent lott, the former republican senate majority leader. “but i have watched over the years when one party has had control of the white house and the senate and the house, and the danger is overplaying your hand. “if you go too far, like what happened with obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,” mr. lott continued. “you have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ” the tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the senate finance committee is already moving in that direction. still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from mr. trump’s chief of staff, reince priebus. the senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for mr. trump. republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. but on many issues, senate democrats     including their new leader, chuck schumer of new york     are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of mr. trump’s agenda. “after campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   trump’s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he’s sworn in,” said senator patty murray, democrat of washington. “democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ” republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that president obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the trump team on which ones should be undone. “i hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,” the house speaker, paul d. ryan of wisconsin, said at a recent forum. “i think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ” in late december, the obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. that regulation, one of dozens that mr. trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. but congress is likely to block it, using the obscure congressional review act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion. given time constraints on the senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. they are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. republicans will also move quickly to repeal the affordable care act. they plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year     already a quarter over     that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any democratic filibuster. but republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace mr. obama’s, and they may delay the repeal measure’s effective date for years. the senate must also consider mr. trump’s cabinet picks, and senate democrats are already trying to slow the process. however, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than supreme court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with mr. trump’s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. republicans have been particularly upset that senator jeff sessions of alabama, whom mr. trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with democrats on the senate judiciary committee or had meetings canceled. senator dianne feinstein of california postponed her meeting with mr. sessions until january because, she said, her schedule got too busy. “the senator doesn’t want to rush,” said her spokesman, tom mentzer. one reason that democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over mr. mcconnell’s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the supreme court nomination of judge merrick b. garland. lingering in the background is the specter of russia. democrats     and some republicans, who are at odds with mr. trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him     want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. the obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. while republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. “this is no time for hubris,” mr. mcconnell said. “you have to perform. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     house republican leaders signaled on monday that they would not support   donald j. trump’s threat to impose a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas, the first significant confrontation over the conservative economic orthodoxy that mr. trump relishes trampling. “i don’t want to get into some kind of trade war,” representative kevin mccarthy, republican of california and majority leader, told reporters in response to mr. trump’s threats over the weekend to seek a 35 percent import tariff on goods sold by united states companies that move jobs overseas and displace american workers. speaker paul d. ryan also pushed back against mr. trump on monday in an interview with a wisconsin reporter, saying an overhaul of the corporate tax code would more effectively keep companies in the united states than tax penalties. “i think we can get at the goal here,” he said, “which is to keep american businesses american, build things in america and sell them overseas     that can be properly addressed with comprehensive tax reform. ” mr. trump’s economic positions clashed with traditional conservatives during the campaign, but now these differences     on trade, government spending on infrastructure, and tax policies     have set the incoming president on a perilous course with the lawmakers whose support he needs to keep his agenda on track. “there will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 percent for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, a. c. units etc. back across the border,” mr. trump said in a series of twitter messages over the weekend. the response from republican leaders underscored the limits of legislating 140 characters at a time on twitter, and gave democrats cause to believe they can work with mr. trump to outmaneuver congressional republicans next year. “the   won in part by campaigning against the republican establishment on many economic issues,” said senator chuck schumer of new york, the incoming democratic leader. “if he wants to get something done for working families in this country, he’ll have to stand up to them when it comes time to govern, too. ” mr. trump first startled republicans during the campaign when he attacked trade deals, putting himself more in line with senator bernie sanders of vermont than mr. ryan. he repeatedly insisted that trade deals had displaced american workers and harmed the economy, upending two centuries of american economic policies that held trade up as a good thing, a position that republicans have pushed in recent decades. his positions helped imperil president obama’s trade pact with asian nations, the   partnership, and abruptly stop further trade negotiations, which many experts in both parties believe limits the united states in its economic position against china, especially when paired with tariff threats. “i respect   trump for fulfilling his campaign promise to withdraw from t. p. p. ,” representative kevin brady, republican of texas and chairman of the powerful house ways and means committee, said shortly after the election. “we can’t abandon these markets to china and other competitors, because american businesses and customers will lose out,” he added. mr. trump made republicans bend to his will     and against their   opposition to picking “winners and losers” in the economy     even before his inauguration when he announced last month that the     manufacturer carrier would keep roughly 1, 000 jobs in the state rather than moving them to mexico, thanks to $7 million in tax incentives negotiated by vice   mike pence, the current governor of indiana. this is the sort of package republicans have traditionally loathed. the once intensely conservative mr. pence channeled the views of mr. sanders when he explained the carrier deal by saying, “the free market has been sorting it out, and america’s been losing. ” mr. ryan and many other fiscal conservatives appeared to agree. “everyone here knows what it means to lose jobs in their districts,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma. “if trump can keep a thousand families from going through such an ordeal, then good for him. and if it makes other companies think twice about the human consequences of their business decisions, so much the better. ” but big tariffs appear too much to abide. both mr. ryan and senator mitch mcconnell, republican of kentucky and the majority leader, supported a bill that gave mr. obama and his successor special “fast track” authority to negotiate trade agreements, and are proponents of reducing tariff barriers. “tax cuts and deregulation will make the american economy great again, but tariffs and trade wars will make it tank again,” david mcintosh, president of the conservative group club for growth, said in a statement, adding, “the majority leader is right to caution against protectionism and to urge a robust debate on free markets and trade. ” house leaders want to tackle the problem of companies’ moving operations overseas with a broad rewriting of the corporate tax code, which they say will make american manufacturing more competitive without resorting to punitive measures on individual companies. “tough talk plays well with his base and is arguably even long overdue,” said brian walsh, a republican consultant and former official at the national republican senatorial committee. “but ultimately, the legislative focus will be on tax reform and deregulation versus tariffs and trade wars. i don’t believe republicans will let a golden opportunity to finally pass comprehensive tax reform fall victim to intraparty squabbling. ” republicans also fought mightily this week to remove a provision from a water bill favored by democrats     and aligned with mr. trump’s campaign promises     that would require the use of   iron and steel for domestic water infrastructure projects. they said they feared the measure would direct federal funding to some domestic companies but not others. mr. trump has long been a proponent of propping up the american steel industry, even though he has used imported steel for some of his building projects. next on the horizon could be a medicare fight. mr. trump said during his campaign that threats to change the program caused his party to lose its bid for the white house in 2012,   mr. ryan in his swipe. mr. trump and mr. ryan are in   mode at present, but how much that holds up remains to be seen. mr. ryan has a proposal to transform the medicaid program into a block grant and change the medicare program so that americans now under 55 would get a specified amount of money from the federal government toward the premium for private health coverage. mr. trump has been inconsistent on the medicare issue, and his choice for secretary of health and human services, representative tom price, shares mr. ryan’s views., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     he didn’t see it coming. speaker paul d. ryan was in a hotel room in cincinnati last may when he learned that donald j. trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the republican nomination for president. mr. trump had recently lost the wisconsin primary, which mr. ryan and other republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. senator ted cruz of texas had made strides, and mr. ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. but he badly miscalculated. the ensuing path, from mr. trump’s securing the nomination to mr. ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in wisconsin a month before election day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that mr. trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. mr. ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of reince priebus, chairman of the republican national committee and a fellow wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to mr. trump. now, mr. ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve republican control of congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. if mr. trump is defeated on nov. 8     as mr. ryan has all but conceded     but republicans maintain their house majority, it will fall largely to mr. ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. there is, of course, the question of whether house members would let him do so. the republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the house decision on whether the speaker should be mr. ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies trumpism. democrats have moved quickly to paint mr. ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of mr. trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying mr. ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. on saturday, mr. ryan’s office added to that criticism of mr. trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for mr. ryan. for his part, mr. trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of mr. ryan. last week, in a series of twitter posts, he called mr. ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee. ” for now, the speaker spends his days treating mr. trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of hillary clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered house republicans. “right now his objective is crystal clear,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma, “to retain the republican majority in the house. in that effort he has helped members of the freedom caucus as well as those in the tuesday group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “we will worry about our internal differences after the election. right now we are in a bar fight and every republican is worth saving. ” that mr. ryan and mr. trump were never natural allies is understandable. they had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the white house, an encounter at a   in new york during the 2012 campaign. mr. ryan was mitt romney’s running mate. their paths would not cross again. “trump really wasn’t on paul’s radar screen,” said a. mark neuman, a ryan friend for two decades. “before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that mr. trump did not share mr. ryan’s passions for the green bay packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and midwest life with children. the relationship showed strains from the start, with mr. ryan alarmed by mr. trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. the speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to mr. trump for other republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “if we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. he made calls to several of the republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda mr. trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (the trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. mr. ryan also declined to be interviewed.) mr. ryan had hoped that mr. trump would eventually embrace his plan. when mr. trump clinched the nomination in may, mr. ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “the conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘don’t worry, this will end,’” said charlie sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in milwaukee and a friend of mr. ryan’s. “so it was a huge shock. i think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” with campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, mr. ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse mr. trump. none of this pleased mr. priebus, who prided himself on building the modern republican party in wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against mrs. clinton. in text messages and phone calls, mr. priebus tried to persuade mr. ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept mr. trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. mr. trump would yell at mr. priebus and in turn mr. priebus would needle mr. ryan. when that did not work, mr. trump claimed mr. ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to capitol hill to try to woo fellow republicans, a claim mr. ryan viewed as a serious breach. “that was the first realization that trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate mr. trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” in june, after a period of relative silence on mr. trump’s part, mr. ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. staff members of both men began to coordinate for the republican national convention. but days later mr. ryan aggressively criticized mr. trump for his remarks about a hispanic judge. another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “he was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” mr. sykes said. a bright spot came in july, when mr. trump chose indiana’s governor, mike pence, who has long been close to mr. ryan, as his running mate. privately, mr. pence tried to assure skeptical republicans that he would impose mr. ryan’s policy agenda if he and mr. trump captured the white house. then in august, mr. trump toyed with endorsing mr. ryan’s opponent in a primary. mr. ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. he watched mr. trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. mr. trump called mr. ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of mr. pence, and to seek debate advice, which mr. ryan said focused on preparation. (not heeded.) by the fall, mr. ryan had basically stopped speaking mr. trump’s name. the nominee made a request through the r. n. c. to campaign with mr. ryan, whose team agreed to invite mr. trump and mr. pence to an event this month in wisconsin. then came the tape of mr. trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. mr. sykes let mr. priebus know via text that mr. trump was no longer welcome in wisconsin. mr. sykes said mr. priebus responded: “i am the guy trying to fix this! i am in tears over this. ’” (a spokeswoman for mr. priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) mr. ryan agonized over his options. ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “i think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, who has renounced mr. trump. “his job is to help house republicans. period. ” mr. ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support mr. trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “we knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” mr. sykes said. “how much damage could they do?”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)    0.547002\n",
      "(in one letter, donald j. trump ranted about the crisis of unsightly hot dog vendors on his beloved fifth avenue. “having ketchup and mustard splattered all over the sidewalk,” he wrote, “is disgraceful. ” in another note, he paid flowery tribute to his young wife, whom he referred to as “my little darling. ” “you’re everything i hoped for,” he wrote. in a different missive, he offered a rare admission of weakness, declaring, “i am nothing more than a frustrated writer of little talent. ” mr. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, is a master of modern media, exploiting twitter and television to punish his enemies, energize his allies and promote himself. but perhaps his most powerful and memorable form of communication is the   ritual of a personal letter, written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping, signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of trump tower. churned out prolifically from a   desk, they are letters of gratitude, hate, flattery and revenge, dispatched to teenage admirers and   mayors, professional athletes and magazine editors. the tone can range from florid to juvenile, pleading to poisonous. tightly clutched and prominently displayed even by those who despise him, the epistles have become keepsakes and mementos for hundreds of people across the country. viewed as a collection from the 1970s to now, they offer an unusual archive of his emotional ups and downs. the 2009 letter that mr. trump sent to mike tollin, a movie director, makes for painful reading: it denounced a film by mr. tollin that explored mr. trump’s role in the collapse of a football league as “third rate” and “extremely dishonest. ” in a fulminating flourish, mr. trump wrote: “p. s. you are a loser. ” nevertheless, mr. tollin had the letter framed and he keeps it on a shelf in his office, next to photographs of his family. “people come by and immediately want to see it, touch it and hold it,” mr. tollin said with pride. today, as mr. trump tries to make peace with hostile figures in his party, the candidate renowned for his rhetorical flame throwing is deploying a conciliatory style of letter writing as his chief weapon. his handwritten overtures have started to arrive in the mailboxes of seemingly implacable foes, like charlie sykes, a conservative radio host in milwaukee, who has described mr. trump as a “whiny,   bully. ” “charlie,” began mr. trump’s note, scribbled with a thick black pen on the front page of the new york times, next to an article about skeptical republicans warming to mr. trump, “i hope you can change your mind. ” ever attuned to incentives, the real estate mogul dangled an offer: “look forward to doing your show,” he wrote, adding, “i will win!” it did not change mr. sykes’s dim view of mr. trump. but he was, he conceded, impressed by the gesture. “give him credit that he’s doing this,” mr. sykes said. “he’s willing to do some things that might be somewhat at odds with his public image. ” the letters     culled from personal and public archives     reveal mr. trump’s insecurities, but also his perceptiveness about power, ego and what motivates people. from early on, he seemed to intuitively grasp the potency of his praise when lavished on   men. in the 1990s, mr. trump occasionally fawned over new york’s brash mayor, rudolph w. giuliani. in one letter, mr. trump tore out a page from a magazine interview in which he had called mr. giuliani “the greatest mayor that the city’s ever had. ” in case mr. giuliani missed the homage, mr. trump drew two bold arrows, each pointing at the glowing passage, and reiterated the message in a handwritten note: “rudy, you are the greatest!” he wrote, adding, “see you soon. ” there is never any question about authorship: mr. trump’s style of writing sounds virtually identical to his hyperbolic manner of speech, with a healthy sprinkling of the words “great” and “tremendous,” abundant displays of   and    claims of success or doom. in a 1985 letter to mayor edward i. koch, mr. trump predicted new york city’s imminent downfall if a fellow real estate developer, arthur e. imperatore sr. were allowed to start a ferry service between new jersey and manhattan. “real estate values and taxes in new york would plummet,” mr. trump prognosticated darkly. “why would anyone want to live or shop in new york?” (mr. imperatore started the ferry service without destroying new york’s economy.) as a writer, mr. trump sometimes reached, awkwardly but earnestly, for eloquence. in a 1983 letter to a. m. rosenthal, then the executive editor of the times and a lunch companion, mr. trump turned poetic as he tried to capture his reaction to an article that mr. rosenthal had written about returning to  poland for the first time in decades. “it is moving it is sad it is hopeful (?) it is devastating,” mr. trump wrote, saying that his wife at the time, ivana, who grew up in eastern europe, agreed. “it truly captured the strength, the will and the soul of the polish people,” mr. trump wrote. he could write with striking tenderness to ivana, according to notes reviewed by the times. “i adore and love my little darling,” he wrote to her in one. “i truly believe that you are the greatest,” he wrote in another. on the page, anyway, mr. trump was even capable of humility, describing himself as a scribe of “little talent” in a 1985 note to arthur ochs sulzberger, then the publisher of the times. (mr. trump had an agenda: to complain about a reporter he disliked.) mr. trump traces his epistolary habits to his attempt to win over franklin m. jarman, who controlled a manhattan department store that mr. trump wanted to buy in the 1970s to make way for trump tower. mr. jarman rarely replied to mr. trump’s letters, but he had, in fact, read them, mr. trump wrote in his book “the art of the deal,” laying the groundwork for an agreement. “the letters i wrote eventually did have an impact,” mr. trump said. for years, mr. trump sent his letters the   way, by mail. but over time, members of his staff dragged him into the internet era     sort of. he still writes by hand, brandishing the favored tool of teachers’ corrections and athletes’ autographs, a black sharpie. now his aides often turn the letters into digital files, scanning them and sending them by email. but he refuses to let anyone else do the writing. “if i had a secretary to do them,” he said in an interview, “they wouldn’t be nearly as effective, they wouldn’t be nearly as sharp. ” each letter concludes with his extravagant signature, which resembles a city skyline or “a seismograph,” as graydon carter, the editor of vanity fair and a repeat recipient of mr. trump’s screeds, described it. many of his letters targeted the famous and credentialed, but from time to time they reached the little known and uninfluential. mr. trump penned a letter of encouragement in 2014 to an    student in texas, john russell niederer, who had expressed a desire to meet him. “work hard and be smart,” mr. trump told him. the letter now hangs on mr. niederer’s bedroom wall. “for him to take the time to send a message to somebody like me,” he said, “was really, really cool. ” a vindictive side is never far from view in mr. trump’s correspondence. after the basketball legend kareem   wrote a critical essay in the washington post about mr. trump’s candidacy, mr. trump sent him a copy of the essay with a biting message sprawled across it. “now i know why the press always treated you so badly     they couldn’t stand you,” mr. trump wrote. “the fact is that you don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make america great again!” mr.   said he was flabbergasted. “it was such a petty and childish reaction, like a teenage boy responding to being turned down for a date by whining, ‘well, nobody likes you!’ ” he said. he likened mr. trump’s decision to write his reply on the original article to “a dog urinating on a tree to mark its territory. ” mr.   had to get rid of the letter. “i crumpled it up real nice and tight and skyhooked it into my wastepaper basket,” he recalled, invoking his trademark shot. others cannot let go. “i’m definitely going to keep it,” mr. sykes, the radio host, said of his letter. “probably in a desk drawer. ”, Michael Barbaro, 6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.543764\n",
      "(when tony schwartz was writing donald j. trump’s first book, “the art of the deal,” in the late 1980s, he was startled by his client’s short attention span. during their first interview, mr. trump endured just a few minutes of mr. schwartz’s questions before leaping up from his chair and declaring the entire exercise a waste of his time. “he couldn’t tolerate doing interviews,” he tells me. “he just couldn’t stay focused for more than a few minutes at a time. and think about this, michael, it was when he was talking about himself, which is his favorite subject. ” in the latest episode of the   mr. schwartz explains why he is sharing his intimate knowledge of how mr. trump thinks and behaves with aides to hillary clinton to help her prepare for monday night’s highly anticipated presidential debate. he’s worried about a habit he noticed during ms. clinton’s performance at a national security forum hosted by nbc news a week ago: “what i would hope is that she doesn’t go the same route she did with matt lauer when he started coming at her relentlessly, which was to revert to her knowledge, to revert to her ability to produce a hundred facts in a short period of time,” he says. “because this debate is going to turn not a bit on the issues. it’s going to turn on emotion, it’s going to turn on which candidate makes all of us feel safer and which candidate makes us feel less safe. and the one who wins that contest wins the debate     and probably wins the election. ” mr. schwartz offered his help to the clinton campaign as part of his long (and possibly futile) effort to make up for the guilt he feels about setting mr. trump on a path to fame by ghostwriting his book. “i don’t think i can ever even the score i don’t think i can ever set it totally straight,” he says. all he can do now, he says, is “say the truth that i know in the service of trying to help save the country and the world from a guy who is exceptionally dangerous. ” in the episode, we explore the profoundly contrasting style of preparation and showmanship that mr. trump and mrs. clinton bring to the debate with my colleagues, frank bruni, an opinion columnist, and amy chozick, a reporter who has covered mrs. clinton for the last two years. “i think of trump as a toddler sitting in a high chair,” mr. bruni says. “and his advisers are saying ‘donald, you must get through the meal without throwing your spaghetti on the wall.’ so the question is, will they successfully persuade him not to throw his spaghetti on the wall before the debate ends?” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(tucson, ariz.     senator john mccain does not say much these days about donald j. trump’s attack on his   years as a prisoner of war. instead, he clenches his teeth and says he will support the republican party’s presumptive nominee, who once said derisively about the senator’s time in captivity, “i like people that weren’t captured. ” in the   swelter here in arizona, his home state, mr. mccain, who was the republicans’ presidential nominee and   in 2008, did not openly bemoan this moment from his long political life. he is focusing on what he considers his toughest   fight yet, and is betting that the only way to keep his seat is to support mr. trump. “i’m fair game. i’m in the arena,” said mr. mccain, 79, whose thinning face reflects the decades he has spent traveling around his massive and increasingly diverse state. still, the episode sits with traces of bitterness, like old coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup, even if he says otherwise. for a moment, the july attack on mr. mccain seemed to be mr. trump’s undoing. mccain said he recalled a recent chat with a world war ii veteran who had been in a german prison camp. as he delivered the man a missing medal, “he said to me, ‘why would trump say something like that about us?’ ” the senator said. “frankly, i didn’t have an answer for it. ” but mr. trump has since called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a wall at the mexican border, and now the billionaire businessman could be the force that ultimately topples the indomitable mr. mccain. an estimated 433, 000 hispanics are expected to vote in arizona this november, an 8 percent increase from 2012. and mr. mccain has a credible democratic challenger, representative ann kirkpatrick, who grew up on an indian reservation and has strong support from the state’s sizable native american population. “i just came from a latino round table, and they are really concerned about mccain’s support for trump,” she said tuesday. “it’s very personal here. ” she is working with the state’s democrats to harness these forces against mr. mccain and his old guard, which is largely behind mr. trump. ms. kirkpatrick said that being   “is a strong message,” but she acknowledged that “it’s not the only message. ” she recently opened a field office in tempe, and has many arizona state university volunteers working the phones. working out of an old bank, aides sit in the former vault (the door has been removed) to go over mr. mccain’s statements, year by year, and look for inconsistencies that suggest too long a stay in congress. “the race comes down to whether arizonans take a step back and judge john mccain for being john mccain and his remarkable life of public service,” said grant woods, a former state attorney general and the senator’s friend for decades. “and not as being a   incumbent, and not as a republican in a year when the party has a controversial nominee. if they do that, he will win walking away. if they don’t, then it could be tight. could he lose? yeah. ” despite the personal attacks by mr. trump on the senator’s integrity and war record, mr. mccain cannot afford to reject mr. trump and alienate his many supporters in arizona if he hopes to hold his seat, an agonizing  . mr. mccain is the embodiment of much that voters in both parties, but especially fans of mr. trump, have said they would like to jettison this year. he is the ultimate establishment player, having served in congress for nearly four decades     five terms in the senate alone. “back in the middle ages, i was known as the maverick,” mr. mccain said, smiling wanly. he is an unapologetic free trader, an interventionist abroad who continues to defend the deeply unpopular war in iraq, a supporter of private industry and markets, and the original, if inconstant, champion of changes to the immigration system that would help some illegal immigrants become citizens. to succeed in what most people believe will be his last political campaign, mr. mccain must canter around the state assuring mr. trump’s detractors that he does not share the businessman’s visions for mass deportation and the dissolution of nato, while continuing to woo an angry republican base that overwhelmingly voted for mr. trump in the state’s march primary. “i’ve been feeling it out there for some time,” mr. mccain said. “in the southern part of the state here, they are not feeling the recovery at all. then there is this whole issue with these young people and kids carrying around all this debt. ” “that’s the bernie effect,” he said, referring to senator bernie sanders’s youth appeal in the democratic primaries. he added: “the turmoil in this race is more than i’ve ever seen. younger, newer voters are registering for only one reason, to vote against trump. so my challenge is to convince that younger, newer voter that i am for them. ” his greater challenge may be with latinos angry at mr. trump. according to an analysis of voter and census data by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials educational fund, latinos are expected to account for 17 percent of arizona’s registered electorate this year, with a voter turnout rate at close to 70 percent. nearly 45 percent of latino registered voters are democrats, the report found. “i’ve always spent a lot of time with the hispanic community,” mr. mccain said, “but having said that, they are rising in numbers in the voting population. i’m putting more emphasis there, particularly in light of trump’s comments. ” hispanics in the phoenix area will also be heavily motivated to vote in the sheriff’s election joe arpaio, a trump supporter who was recently found in contempt of court for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining latinos, will be on the ballot, trying to keep his seat as maricopa county sheriff. a day watching mr. mccain campaign here this past week reflects his evolving challenges. he sat for the endorsement of a small group of border patrol agents, who have also endorsed mr. trump, and listened in silence as art del cueto, the president of tucson local 2455 of the national border patrol council, explained why mr. trump had gotten their approval. “it means so much to me this long relationship we’ve had,” mr. mccain said about his endorsement, “and the support we’ve tried to provide. ” mr. del cueto did say that “we did talk to donald” about his comments concerning mr. mccain’s war record. “i don’t think it was a comment that has been made again,” he said. but a bit later, meeting with hispanic business leaders, mr. mccain opened with “we’re going to make america great again and it’s going to be huge, o. k.?” it was a tiny swipe at mr. trump, taken in the manner of a toddler grabbing a cookie when he assumes no one is looking. then it was on to other topics, like the federal aviation administration reauthorization. mr. mccain remains most at home with other veterans, like the one he visited     on memorial day, another man waiting on medals. “his wife said he was staying alive to get those medals,” mr. mccain said, smiling at the memory. “sometimes it’s a nice job. ”,

      "(washington     paul d. ryan, the reluctant house speaker, eager 2012   nominee and youthful answer to hillary clinton, should be sprinting toward the republican convention, a bright, optimistic star poised to sell his party’s agenda. instead, mr. ryan finds himself essentially slouching toward cleveland, hampered in the house by restive republicans and emboldened democrats, and his spotlight taken by a nominee who has yet to fully earn his respect. mr. ryan’s fledgling speakership, which he once suggested would be one giant policy discussion, has instead been a series of extraordinary challenges. he has sought to be the voice of moral clarity for his party, even as republicans fracture over the divisive candidacy of donald j. trump. he has tried to ground himself in republican policy as the country’s political axis has shifted after terrorist attacks and gun violence, and has taken to more populist economic views. mr. ryan, the country’s   republican, seeks to maintain his stature in the party without alienating its trumpian factions or its   traditionalists. his most basic legislative agenda     getting a budget and spending bills passed     has failed, killed off by his right flank. he has been through a month of altercations with democrats over gun legislation, and now is forced to punish them for their   on the house floor. what would seem to be among his easier tasks     backing the presumptive republican presidential nominee     has become a bizarre ritual of alternately denouncing and then supporting mr. trump, on an almost weekly basis. an attempt to pass a modest bill aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring guns has been deeply resisted by many republicans, even though their senate counterparts want it. instead of sitting around poring over policy with committee chairmen, mr. ryan, 46, spends much of his day dealing with minor member issues, like complaints that he did not return messages quickly enough. mr. ryan grudgingly agreed to his speakership     for which he was drafted under protest     to give his party a sense of unity and stability. he now finds himself in the most chaotic climate his party has seen in more than a generation. “paul ryan has stepped into an enormously complicated situation,” said representative charlie dent of pennsylvania, who is one of the moderate house republicans who have distanced themselves from mr. trump. “the underlying dynamics that drove out john boehner remain,” mr. dent said of the former speaker. “now you have donald trump and all his rhetoric, and he knows most of his members want him to support trump while others like me want to keep their distance. then, not being able to pass a budget may be one of the greatest frustrations for the speaker. a lot of members don’t want anything to do with firearms or the budget. they want to cancel the session after the election. that is where we are. ” unlike mr. boehner, who went sailing into private life after being deposed by conservatives, mr. ryan continues to cheerfully promote the house agenda. he makes frequent television appearances and attends local media events at home in wisconsin. he will tell anyone who will listen about the conservative policy agenda he intends to pursue next year, in spite of the possibility that mrs. clinton might be in the white house. further, mr. trump has shown little interest in his priorities so far. “when the speaker took the job, he did it to help steady the ship at a difficult moment,” said brendan buck, a spokesman for mr. ryan. “he continues to try to be a stabilizing figure for the party and this place. ” also, unlike mr. boehner, mr. ryan remains largely popular with his fellow house republicans, who have appreciated his inclusive style. even among supporters of mr. trump, there is respect for mr. ryan’s consistency on core party issues. it is particularly rankling for mr. ryan, a former chairman of the house budget committee, that he is unable to pass a budget. the most conservative house republicans do not want to honor a deal struck by mr. boehner and the white house last year, which raised statutory budget caps to increase government spending. many have made it clear they will not vote for a budget with that higher spending level. this has made the appropriations process equally charged. but that is where mr. ryan has other problems. those bills have failed because of fights over  an amendment to bar federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, fights over the use of the confederate flag and other social issues. with republicans likely to lose seats in november, narrowing their large majority in the house, the most conservative members are likely to make up a larger, not small percentage of his conference after november. gerrymandered republican house districts, which produce very conservative members, and the probable sweeping out of moderate members in a presidential year combine to make it so. democrats, smelling blood but not well positioned to take back the house, have instead challenged mr. ryan. two weeks ago, a rattled mr. ryan looked out on the house floor, where he has spent much of his adult life, and saw hundreds of democrats, including many with whom he has served for years, shouting him down over gun control legislation. at 3 a. m. the heckles seemed to engulf the normally affable speaker as he struggled to call a vote on yet another bill that would go nowhere     this one helping to fight the zika virus. two weeks later, and the day after the death of five police officers in dallas, mr. ryan stared out at those same colleagues and begged for conciliation in a moving speech on the floor. “there will be a temptation to let our anger harden our divisions,” mr. ryan said friday. “let’s not let that happen. let’s defy those predictions. ” democrats, who had planned another set of protests that day, stood down. still, mr. ryan has vowed some form of punishment for their  . what happened on the house floor over the past few weeks “illustrated just how he is caught in the currents within his own party,” said representative sander m. levin, democrat of michigan, who served with mr. ryan on the ways and means committee and is close to him. “i was surprised by his comments that our gun protests were a political stunt when he knew better,” mr. levin said. “he knew people like john lewis and myself are not   people. his comment was contrary to the way he usually conducts himself. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(as with so many elements of this presidential campaign, the way in which hillary clinton and donald j. trump have handled their medical histories feels strange, secretive and theatrical (dr. oz, anyone? ). but there’s a long and rich history of candidates concealing     even lying about     the details of their health. in the latest episode of the   we talk to john dickerson, a history buff, columnist at slate and moderator of cbs’s “face the nation,” who recalls the united states’ pivotal brush with a president’s   ailment: the heart attack of dwight d. eisenhower in 1955. mr. dickerson, the author of “whistlestop,” a new book about the history of presidential campaigns, explains how the white house’s initial resistance to disclose the incident triggered something new in american public life: a deluge of deeply private medical information about the commander in chief. we also speak with the doctor who, more than anyone else, is responsible for our modern expectation that candidates give detailed disclosures about their health: lawrence k. altman, a reporter at the new york times who was the first to interview candidates about their medical histories. mr. altman recalls his tough and sadly prescient question to ronald reagan when he was a candidate in 1980 about a potential condition that would later haunt him. we also hear from voters in times square about whether they even care about candidates’ health. short answer: not particularly. one voter told us he’d be going with mrs. clinton over mr. trump. was there anything about her health that might change that? “i’m pretty sure he’s crazy,” the man said, “and that’s more dangerous than her dying in office. ” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(there’s a forgotten scene in the third season of “the sopranos” when the wives of the show’s mob crew, sitting inside a local italian restaurant, turn to the delicate subject of hillary clinton, monica lewinsky, infidelity and marriage. it’s 2001 and mrs. clinton is headed to the senate. the women assembled around the table, all of whom know their husbands are unfaithful, are simultaneously disgusted by mrs. clinton and in awe of her. “i can’t stand that woman,” says angie bonpensiero. “i don’t know,” says rosalie aprile. “maybe we could all take a page from her book. ” it’s left to the boss’s wife, carmela soprano to sort through her own messy emotions. she veers from instinctive revulsion (“to be humiliated in public then walk around smiling all the time”) to grudging admiration for how a woman not unlike herself, overshadowed by a cheating spouse, has emerged as powerful, independent figure in her own right. “she’s a role model for all of us,” mrs. soprano says on second thought, as the wives nod in agreement. in the latest episode of the   we examine a potent electoral force we rarely talk about when we talk about the campaign: pop culture. both mrs. clinton and donald j. trump are   stars in their own right, who have spawned     and inspired     television characters and shows from “the apprentice” (mr. trump) to the “the good wife” (mrs. clinton). we talk to the chief television critic at the new york times, james poniewozik, about how television and film characters past and present inform our views of both candidates     or have been created in the candidates’ images. “they are both characters in pop culture, characters in mass media, whose stories we have literally been hearing for decades,” mr. poniewozik says of the candidates. “usually in an election, there’s some narrative of some new character you haven’t encountered before: barack obama in 2008, george w. bush in 2000. here, it’s two   american television serials having a crossover episode. ” so if this   campaign is a crossover television event, how would mr. poniewozik, as a tv critic, review the show? “i think the writers have really taken it over the top. it’s like watching ‘scandal’ in its eighth season where you just feel that they have exhausted every possible trick and they’re emptying their notebooks at you. ” would you commit to another season? “i think i’d like to see it recast. ” and we chat with susan dominus, of the times magazine, about the surprising ways that gender is playing out in pop cultural depictions of mr. trump and mrs. clinton in this campaign, a topic she is studying closely this year. “if we are going to extend gender stereotypes all the way to their worst place, it’s celebrity, lightweight     that reads as in some ways feminine and inconsequential or not perceived as a real threat,” ms. dominus says. and in that sense, mr. trump, in some ways, is the more feminized figure. “for all of his bluster, when was the last time that people were this obsessed with a candidate’s hair?” ms. dominus asks. “it was hillary in 2008!” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(when tony schwartz was writing donald j. trump’s first book, “the art of the deal,” in the late 1980s, he was startled by his client’s short attention span. during their first interview, mr. trump endured just a few minutes of mr. schwartz’s questions before leaping up from his chair and declaring the entire exercise a waste of his time. “he couldn’t tolerate doing interviews,” he tells me. “he just couldn’t stay focused for more than a few minutes at a time. and think about this, michael, it was when he was talking about himself, which is his favorite subject. ” in the latest episode of the   mr. schwartz explains why he is sharing his intimate knowledge of how mr. trump thinks and behaves with aides to hillary clinton to help her prepare for monday night’s highly anticipated presidential debate. he’s worried about a habit he noticed during ms. clinton’s performance at a national security forum hosted by nbc news a week ago: “what i would hope is that she doesn’t go the same route she did with matt lauer when he started coming at her relentlessly, which was to revert to her knowledge, to revert to her ability to produce a hundred facts in a short period of time,” he says. “because this debate is going to turn not a bit on the issues. it’s going to turn on emotion, it’s going to turn on which candidate makes all of us feel safer and which candidate makes us feel less safe. and the one who wins that contest wins the debate     and probably wins the election. ” mr. schwartz offered his help to the clinton campaign as part of his long (and possibly futile) effort to make up for the guilt he feels about setting mr. trump on a path to fame by ghostwriting his book. “i don’t think i can ever even the score i don’t think i can ever set it totally straight,” he says. all he can do now, he says, is “say the truth that i know in the service of trying to help save the country and the world from a guy who is exceptionally dangerous. ” in the episode, we explore the profoundly contrasting style of preparation and showmanship that mr. trump and mrs. clinton bring to the debate with my colleagues, frank bruni, an opinion columnist, and amy chozick, a reporter who has covered mrs. clinton for the last two years. “i think of trump as a toddler sitting in a high chair,” mr. bruni says. “and his advisers are saying ‘donald, you must get through the meal without throwing your spaghetti on the wall.’ so the question is, will they successfully persuade him not to throw his spaghetti on the wall before the debate ends?” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(did hillary clinton, or somebody very much like her, have to be the first woman to get this close to winning the presidency? we explore that question in the latest episode of the   with claire mccaskill, the senior united states senator from missouri, and gail collins, a new york times columnist who has written several books on women’s history. what   combination of factors is required for a country to embrace a woman as its leader for the first time? longtime public exposure? proximity to power? moderate politics? and how powerful, perhaps even necessary, is it that this first woman be the spouse of a former president? history offers a guide: the first female president of any country was isabel martínez de perón of argentina, the wife of its former president. the first woman elected to the united states senate, hattie wyatt caraway, was the widow of a senator. and now the united states has the first woman candidate in the general election. “given our history it’s not surprising it’s the wife of somebody who had the job first,” ms. collins said. “some day we’ll have some really charismatic woman who gets people all excited, and it doesn’t matter that she’s only been in the senate for two years and that we don’t know much about her except her story,” ms. collins said. mrs. clinton’s presidential runs will have paved the way for that woman to have a shot. “no matter what happens in this election, one of the great contributions hillary clinton has made to american history is that she made it seem sort of normal to have a woman running for president in 2008,” ms. collins said. “before then it had never been a normal thing. ” america is behind many other countries on that front, as senator mccaskill pointed out. “many of us are painfully aware of how many countries around the world have elected and admired women executives in their government, and it is embarrassing to many of us that america has not taken that step,” she said. “the irony is that everyone always would pat women on the head and say ‘well you know as soon as a woman is qualified there will be a woman president,’ ” senator mccaskill said. “now we have a stark differential in qualifications, and now it seems to be all about her integrity and how likable she is. ” in the episode, we discuss the challenges of running against a woman with former representative rick lazio of long island, a man who discovered those pitfalls in a very public fashion. in 2000, he was mrs. clinton’s opponent in the race for the united states senate seat in new york. in a   debate moment, mr. lazio approached mrs. clinton’s podium to ask her to sign a pledge, a tactic many saw as an overly aggressive male gesture toward a female rival. mr. lazio told us it was a mistake that he still regrets     and one whose visual impact he underestimated in the moment. “our folks all thought we had won the debate hands down,” he told us. but the next day, he saw that clip played over and over again and realized that the moment was going to stick. “the mistake that i made     and it was a mistake     was to create an optic where it looked like i was somebody other than who i was it looked like i was invading her space and was not chivalrous,” he told us. “it was spun in the media and shown over and over again, and it looked like it was an overbearing male approaching a female. ” please let us know what you think of the  . you can reach us at therunup@nytimes. com, or find me on twitter. you can also rate and review us on itunes. from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(on the eve of our debut episode of “the daily,” president trump delivered a major news story. for his first supreme court nomination, he selected neil m. gorsuch, a conservative judge with a sterling résumé. i spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful new york times colleagues about what it means. maggie haberman, a white house reporter, explains mr. trump’s reverence for the supreme court. carl hulse, the dean of congressional reporters, explains what to expect during the confirmation process. and adam liptak, our chief legal correspondent, introduces the country’s new supreme court nominee. to understand more about judge gorsuch, i also talk to david green, the chief executive of hobby lobby, a company at the center of one of judge gorsuch’s most important cases. he ruled that corporations with religious owners     like hobby lobby     cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. “we voted for trump, not that we agree with everything he does,” mr. green tells me on the show, speaking for himself and his wife. “the most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the constitution,” he said, referring to the supreme court. “because if you rule on the constitution, it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something, and that we would have our religious liberties. ” tune in, and tell us what you think. email us at thedaily@nytimes. com. tweet me at @mikiebarb. and if that isn’t enough, we can even text. if you are on your phone and don’t see an audio player on this page, follow the instructions below. on your iphone or ipad: open the preloaded app called “podcasts” it has a purple icon. if you’re reading this from your phone, tap this link, which will take you straight there.

      "(washington     he didn’t see it coming. speaker paul d. ryan was in a hotel room in cincinnati last may when he learned that donald j. trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the republican nomination for president. mr. trump had recently lost the wisconsin primary, which mr. ryan and other republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. senator ted cruz of texas had made strides, and mr. ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. but he badly miscalculated. the ensuing path, from mr. trump’s securing the nomination to mr. ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in wisconsin a month before election day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that mr. trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. mr. ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of reince priebus, chairman of the republican national committee and a fellow wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to mr. trump. now, mr. ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve republican control of congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. if mr. trump is defeated on nov. 8     as mr. ryan has all but conceded     but republicans maintain their house majority, it will fall largely to mr. ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. there is, of course, the question of whether house members would let him do so. the republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the house decision on whether the speaker should be mr. ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies trumpism. democrats have moved quickly to paint mr. ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of mr. trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying mr. ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. on saturday, mr. ryan’s office added to that criticism of mr. trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for mr. ryan. for his part, mr. trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of mr. ryan. last week, in a series of twitter posts, he called mr. ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee. ” for now, the speaker spends his days treating mr. trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of hillary clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered house republicans. “right now his objective is crystal clear,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma, “to retain the republican majority in the house. in that effort he has helped members of the freedom caucus as well as those in the tuesday group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “we will worry about our internal differences after the election. right now we are in a bar fight and every republican is worth saving. ” that mr. ryan and mr. trump were never natural allies is understandable. they had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the white house, an encounter at a   in new york during the 2012 campaign. mr. ryan was mitt romney’s running mate. their paths would not cross again. “trump really wasn’t on paul’s radar screen,” said a. mark neuman, a ryan friend for two decades. “before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that mr. trump did not share mr. ryan’s passions for the green bay packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and midwest life with children. the relationship showed strains from the start, with mr. ryan alarmed by mr. trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. the speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to mr. trump for other republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “if we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. he made calls to several of the republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda mr. trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (the trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. mr. ryan also declined to be interviewed.) mr. ryan had hoped that mr. trump would eventually embrace his plan. when mr. trump clinched the nomination in may, mr. ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “the conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘don’t worry, this will end,’” said charlie sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in milwaukee and a friend of mr. ryan’s. “so it was a huge shock. i think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” with campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, mr. ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse mr. trump. none of this pleased mr. priebus, who prided himself on building the modern republican party in wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against mrs. clinton. in text messages and phone calls, mr. priebus tried to persuade mr. ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept mr. trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. mr. trump would yell at mr. priebus and in turn mr. priebus would needle mr. ryan. when that did not work, mr. trump claimed mr. ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to capitol hill to try to woo fellow republicans, a claim mr. ryan viewed as a serious breach. “that was the first realization that trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate mr. trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” in june, after a period of relative silence on mr. trump’s part, mr. ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. staff members of both men began to coordinate for the republican national convention. but days later mr. ryan aggressively criticized mr. trump for his remarks about a hispanic judge. another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “he was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” mr. sykes said. a bright spot came in july, when mr. trump chose indiana’s governor, mike pence, who has long been close to mr. ryan, as his running mate. privately, mr. pence tried to assure skeptical republicans that he would impose mr. ryan’s policy agenda if he and mr. trump captured the white house. then in august, mr. trump toyed with endorsing mr. ryan’s opponent in a primary. mr. ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. he watched mr. trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. mr. trump called mr. ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of mr. pence, and to seek debate advice, which mr. ryan said focused on preparation. (not heeded.) by the fall, mr. ryan had basically stopped speaking mr. trump’s name. the nominee made a request through the r. n. c. to campaign with mr. ryan, whose team agreed to invite mr. trump and mr. pence to an event this month in wisconsin. then came the tape of mr. trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. mr. sykes let mr. priebus know via text that mr. trump was no longer welcome in wisconsin. mr. sykes said mr. priebus responded: “i am the guy trying to fix this! i am in tears over this. ’” (a spokeswoman for mr. priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) mr. ryan agonized over his options. ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “i think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, who has renounced mr. trump. “his job is to help house republicans. period. ” mr. ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support mr. trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “we knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” mr. sykes said. “how much damage could they do?”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)    0.516286\n",
      "(washington     when donald j. trump goes low, congressional republicans go quiet. their tolerance of mr. trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for  . but on one point, all sides agree: they have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. and mr. trump’s provocations are making the republicans’ control of the senate, perhaps even the house, more tenuous. many republicans, even those whose contempt for mr. trump matches their ill will for president obama, still view the choice between mr. trump and hillary clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. they believe that mr. trump, guided by a   congress, will break their way more than mrs. clinton ever would. for others, the vacancy on the supreme court     and its potential to reshape the high court’s rulings for years     overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee’s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts. “the supreme court is probably the choice that will have the single most   effect on the nation,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, where mr. trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly republican state. congressional republicans who are up for       especially the handful like senators john mccain of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire who still face primaries     have made a basic calculation. they have criticized mr. trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. and party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and mr. trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities. alienating mr. trump’s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. their fears at this point appear justified. a poll conducted the last week of july by cbs news found that support for mr. trump among republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent. so the leaders largely responded to mr. trump’s attacks with feigned indifference. “republican elected officials are in a tough spot,” said nathan l. gonzales, the editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report, a nonpartisan newsletter. “they are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. some republicans are reluctant to attack donald trump because they’d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries. ” mr. trump pointedly declined on tuesday to endorse speaker paul d. ryan, the nation’s   elected republican, and verged on outright opposition to mr. mccain and ms. ayotte, just hours after mr. obama challenged republicans to denounce their nominee. both mr. obama and mr. trump have put republicans into an untenable position: criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for       but sitting idly as mr. trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters. “if you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?” mr. obama asked during a news conference on tuesday. mr. ryan’s spokesman tersely responded that the speaker had never sought mr. trump’s endorsement, and ms. ayotte more or less brushed off the matter, saying, “i call it like i see it,” in reference to her defense of a fallen army captain whose family mr. trump had derided. while many republicans are hoping for ticket splitters     those who might vote democrat for president but republican on the rest of the ticket     the parsing is all the more difficult. many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. “in 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,” said fergus cullen, a former chairman of the new hampshire republican party. “it was not like passover, where the door was marked, ‘this one should be spared.’ no, the angel of death came in and said no ‘let’s kill them all.’ ” it is not just a question of individual desires to win       although that certainly drives many of the statements about mr. trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. republicans believe they need to maintain the house and the senate, through a   blend of votes from their base and   split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda. “the speaker’s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,” said kevin madden, a republican operative who once worked for former speaker john a. boehner. “the political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms. ” republican leaders also know that in an   election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the washington establishment. this was the lesson senator ted cruz of texas learned when he was booed from the stage at the republican convention last month for declining to get behind mr. trump, and accounts for some of the heat that senator ben sasse of nebraska, a founder of the never trump movement, has taken from his party back home this year. then, there is the vehement opposition to mrs. clinton, especially how they view her role in the benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among republicans. “i happen to think that lying to the american people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of donald trump,” said mr. chaffetz, the chairman of the house oversight committee. he added: “nothing united republicans more than hillary clinton. ” some still may pull away. on tuesday, representative richard hanna, republican of new york, said he would endorse mrs. clinton for president, calling mr. trump “unfit to serve. ” but mr. hanna is not representative of the broader republican conference. “he came to congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,” mr. gonzales said. “he would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek  . but since he’s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what’s on his mind. ” but if mr. trump falls in the polls and republicans running for   start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for   voters, mr. hanna might not be alone., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     paul d. ryan, the reluctant house speaker, eager 2012   nominee and youthful answer to hillary clinton, should be sprinting toward the republican convention, a bright, optimistic star poised to sell his party’s agenda. instead, mr. ryan finds himself essentially slouching toward cleveland, hampered in the house by restive republicans and emboldened democrats, and his spotlight taken by a nominee who has yet to fully earn his respect. mr. ryan’s fledgling speakership, which he once suggested would be one giant policy discussion, has instead been a series of extraordinary challenges. he has sought to be the voice of moral clarity for his party, even as republicans fracture over the divisive candidacy of donald j. trump. he has tried to ground himself in republican policy as the country’s political axis has shifted after terrorist attacks and gun violence, and has taken to more populist economic views. mr. ryan, the country’s   republican, seeks to maintain his stature in the party without alienating its trumpian factions or its   traditionalists. his most basic legislative agenda     getting a budget and spending bills passed     has failed, killed off by his right flank. he has been through a month of altercations with democrats over gun legislation, and now is forced to punish them for their   on the house floor. what would seem to be among his easier tasks     backing the presumptive republican presidential nominee     has become a bizarre ritual of alternately denouncing and then supporting mr. trump, on an almost weekly basis. an attempt to pass a modest bill aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring guns has been deeply resisted by many republicans, even though their senate counterparts want it. instead of sitting around poring over policy with committee chairmen, mr. ryan, 46, spends much of his day dealing with minor member issues, like complaints that he did not return messages quickly enough. mr. ryan grudgingly agreed to his speakership     for which he was drafted under protest     to give his party a sense of unity and stability. he now finds himself in the most chaotic climate his party has seen in more than a generation. “paul ryan has stepped into an enormously complicated situation,” said representative charlie dent of pennsylvania, who is one of the moderate house republicans who have distanced themselves from mr. trump. “the underlying dynamics that drove out john boehner remain,” mr. dent said of the former speaker. “now you have donald trump and all his rhetoric, and he knows most of his members want him to support trump while others like me want to keep their distance. then, not being able to pass a budget may be one of the greatest frustrations for the speaker. a lot of members don’t want anything to do with firearms or the budget. they want to cancel the session after the election. that is where we are. ” unlike mr. boehner, who went sailing into private life after being deposed by conservatives, mr. ryan continues to cheerfully promote the house agenda. he makes frequent television appearances and attends local media events at home in wisconsin. he will tell anyone who will listen about the conservative policy agenda he intends to pursue next year, in spite of the possibility that mrs. clinton might be in the white house. further, mr. trump has shown little interest in his priorities so far. “when the speaker took the job, he did it to help steady the ship at a difficult moment,” said brendan buck, a spokesman for mr. ryan. “he continues to try to be a stabilizing figure for the party and this place. ” also, unlike mr. boehner, mr. ryan remains largely popular with his fellow house republicans, who have appreciated his inclusive style. even among supporters of mr. trump, there is respect for mr. ryan’s consistency on core party issues. it is particularly rankling for mr. ryan, a former chairman of the house budget committee, that he is unable to pass a budget. the most conservative house republicans do not want to honor a deal struck by mr. boehner and the white house last year, which raised statutory budget caps to increase government spending. many have made it clear they will not vote for a budget with that higher spending level. this has made the appropriations process equally charged. but that is where mr. ryan has other problems. those bills have failed because of fights over  an amendment to bar federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, fights over the use of the confederate flag and other social issues. with republicans likely to lose seats in november, narrowing their large majority in the house, the most conservative members are likely to make up a larger, not small percentage of his conference after november. gerrymandered republican house districts, which produce very conservative members, and the probable sweeping out of moderate members in a presidential year combine to make it so. democrats, smelling blood but not well positioned to take back the house, have instead challenged mr. ryan. two weeks ago, a rattled mr. ryan looked out on the house floor, where he has spent much of his adult life, and saw hundreds of democrats, including many with whom he has served for years, shouting him down over gun control legislation. at 3 a. m. the heckles seemed to engulf the normally affable speaker as he struggled to call a vote on yet another bill that would go nowhere     this one helping to fight the zika virus. two weeks later, and the day after the death of five police officers in dallas, mr. ryan stared out at those same colleagues and begged for conciliation in a moving speech on the floor. “there will be a temptation to let our anger harden our divisions,” mr. ryan said friday. “let’s not let that happen. let’s defy those predictions. ” democrats, who had planned another set of protests that day, stood down. still, mr. ryan has vowed some form of punishment for their  . what happened on the house floor over the past few weeks “illustrated just how he is caught in the currents within his own party,” said representative sander m. levin, democrat of michigan, who served with mr. ryan on the ways and means committee and is close to him. “i was surprised by his comments that our gun protests were a political stunt when he knew better,” mr. levin said. “he knew people like john lewis and myself are not   people. his comment was contrary to the way he usually conducts himself. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(in one letter, donald j. trump ranted about the crisis of unsightly hot dog vendors on his beloved fifth avenue. “having ketchup and mustard splattered all over the sidewalk,” he wrote, “is disgraceful. ” in another note, he paid flowery tribute to his young wife, whom he referred to as “my little darling. ” “you’re everything i hoped for,” he wrote. in a different missive, he offered a rare admission of weakness, declaring, “i am nothing more than a frustrated writer of little talent. ” mr. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, is a master of modern media, exploiting twitter and television to punish his enemies, energize his allies and promote himself. but perhaps his most powerful and memorable form of communication is the   ritual of a personal letter, written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping, signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of trump tower. churned out prolifically from a   desk, they are letters of gratitude, hate, flattery and revenge, dispatched to teenage admirers and   mayors, professional athletes and magazine editors. the tone can range from florid to juvenile, pleading to poisonous. tightly clutched and prominently displayed even by those who despise him, the epistles have become keepsakes and mementos for hundreds of people across the country. viewed as a collection from the 1970s to now, they offer an unusual archive of his emotional ups and downs. the 2009 letter that mr. trump sent to mike tollin, a movie director, makes for painful reading: it denounced a film by mr. tollin that explored mr. trump’s role in the collapse of a football league as “third rate” and “extremely dishonest. ” in a fulminating flourish, mr. trump wrote: “p. s. you are a loser. ” nevertheless, mr. tollin had the letter framed and he keeps it on a shelf in his office, next to photographs of his family. “people come by and immediately want to see it, touch it and hold it,” mr. tollin said with pride. today, as mr. trump tries to make peace with hostile figures in his party, the candidate renowned for his rhetorical flame throwing is deploying a conciliatory style of letter writing as his chief weapon. his handwritten overtures have started to arrive in the mailboxes of seemingly implacable foes, like charlie sykes, a conservative radio host in milwaukee, who has described mr. trump as a “whiny,   bully. ” “charlie,” began mr. trump’s note, scribbled with a thick black pen on the front page of the new york times, next to an article about skeptical republicans warming to mr. trump, “i hope you can change your mind. ” ever attuned to incentives, the real estate mogul dangled an offer: “look forward to doing your show,” he wrote, adding, “i will win!” it did not change mr. sykes’s dim view of mr. trump. but he was, he conceded, impressed by the gesture. “give him credit that he’s doing this,” mr. sykes said. “he’s willing to do some things that might be somewhat at odds with his public image. ” the letters     culled from personal and public archives     reveal mr. trump’s insecurities, but also his perceptiveness about power, ego and what motivates people. from early on, he seemed to intuitively grasp the potency of his praise when lavished on   men. in the 1990s, mr. trump occasionally fawned over new york’s brash mayor, rudolph w. giuliani. in one letter, mr. trump tore out a page from a magazine interview in which he had called mr. giuliani “the greatest mayor that the city’s ever had. ” in case mr. giuliani missed the homage, mr. trump drew two bold arrows, each pointing at the glowing passage, and reiterated the message in a handwritten note: “rudy, you are the greatest!” he wrote, adding, “see you soon. ” there is never any question about authorship: mr. trump’s style of writing sounds virtually identical to his hyperbolic manner of speech, with a healthy sprinkling of the words “great” and “tremendous,” abundant displays of   and    claims of success or doom. in a 1985 letter to mayor edward i. koch, mr. trump predicted new york city’s imminent downfall if a fellow real estate developer, arthur e. imperatore sr. were allowed to start a ferry service between new jersey and manhattan. “real estate values and taxes in new york would plummet,” mr. trump prognosticated darkly. “why would anyone want to live or shop in new york?” (mr. imperatore started the ferry service without destroying new york’s economy.) as a writer, mr. trump sometimes reached, awkwardly but earnestly, for eloquence. in a 1983 letter to a. m. rosenthal, then the executive editor of the times and a lunch companion, mr. trump turned poetic as he tried to capture his reaction to an article that mr. rosenthal had written about returning to  poland for the first time in decades. “it is moving it is sad it is hopeful (?) it is devastating,” mr. trump wrote, saying that his wife at the time, ivana, who grew up in eastern europe, agreed. “it truly captured the strength, the will and the soul of the polish people,” mr. trump wrote. he could write with striking tenderness to ivana, according to notes reviewed by the times. “i adore and love my little darling,” he wrote to her in one. “i truly believe that you are the greatest,” he wrote in another. on the page, anyway, mr. trump was even capable of humility, describing himself as a scribe of “little talent” in a 1985 note to arthur ochs sulzberger, then the publisher of the times. (mr. trump had an agenda: to complain about a reporter he disliked.) mr. trump traces his epistolary habits to his attempt to win over franklin m. jarman, who controlled a manhattan department store that mr. trump wanted to buy in the 1970s to make way for trump tower. mr. jarman rarely replied to mr. trump’s letters, but he had, in fact, read them, mr. trump wrote in his book “the art of the deal,” laying the groundwork for an agreement. “the letters i wrote eventually did have an impact,” mr. trump said. for years, mr. trump sent his letters the   way, by mail. but over time, members of his staff dragged him into the internet era     sort of. he still writes by hand, brandishing the favored tool of teachers’ corrections and athletes’ autographs, a black sharpie. now his aides often turn the letters into digital files, scanning them and sending them by email. but he refuses to let anyone else do the writing. “if i had a secretary to do them,” he said in an interview, “they wouldn’t be nearly as effective, they wouldn’t be nearly as sharp. ” each letter concludes with his extravagant signature, which resembles a city skyline or “a seismograph,” as graydon carter, the editor of vanity fair and a repeat recipient of mr. trump’s screeds, described it. many of his letters targeted the famous and credentialed, but from time to time they reached the little known and uninfluential. mr. trump penned a letter of encouragement in 2014 to an    student in texas, john russell niederer, who had expressed a desire to meet him. “work hard and be smart,” mr. trump told him. the letter now hangs on mr. niederer’s bedroom wall. “for him to take the time to send a message to somebody like me,” he said, “was really, really cool. ” a vindictive side is never far from view in mr. trump’s correspondence. after the basketball legend kareem   wrote a critical essay in the washington post about mr. trump’s candidacy, mr. trump sent him a copy of the essay with a biting message sprawled across it. “now i know why the press always treated you so badly     they couldn’t stand you,” mr. trump wrote. “the fact is that you don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make america great again!” mr.   said he was flabbergasted. “it was such a petty and childish reaction, like a teenage boy responding to being turned down for a date by whining, ‘well, nobody likes you!’ ” he said. he likened mr. trump’s decision to write his reply on the original article to “a dog urinating on a tree to mark its territory. ” mr.   had to get rid of the letter. “i crumpled it up real nice and tight and skyhooked it into my wastepaper basket,” he recalled, invoking his trademark shot. others cannot let go. “i’m definitely going to keep it,” mr. sykes, the radio host, said of his letter. “probably in a desk drawer. ”, Michael Barbaro, 6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.395882\n",
      "(o’fallon, mo.     for much of the year, democrats viewed jason kander as a perfect senate candidate running in the wrong state. a charismatic former military intelligence officer and missouri’s current secretary of state, mr. kander, 35, faced an entrenched republican incumbent in a place where donald j. trump seemed destined to win. then mr. kander released a television ad last month in which he put an   assault rifle together blindfolded while reciting a script about gun rights, and started assailing his rival, senator roy d. blunt, on his lobbyist ties. suddenly, it was game on. mr. kander’s poll numbers soared. so did the panic among republicans trying to save mr. blunt, and possibly their senate majority. mr. kander’s ascent is the starkest demonstration of the volatile and at times confounding dynamics of the battle for control of the senate, with at least six races in a statistical dead heat just over two weeks before election day. surprisingly, democrats have improved their chances in places like missouri and north carolina, where they seemed to have no shot just six months ago, while they have all but given up in ohio and pulled their money out of florida, where prospects had seemed bright. republicans continue to cling to hope in new hampshire, nevada and pennsylvania, despite what looks like faltering support for mr. trump in those states. in several cases, individual state dynamics, candidate quality and a   spending spree have had as much to do with the shifting prospects as the top of the ticket. “with two weeks to go, control of the senate is up for grabs,” said nathan gonzales, editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report. “if republicans can break even in the tossup states, they have a chance to maintain control. but if the landscape shifts just a couple of points against republican candidates, democrats will capture the majority. ” in perhaps the oddest quirk of a decidedly erratic year, mr. kander may be benefiting from mr. trump’s   message. mr. blunt, who has served in congress since 1997 and whose family is chockablock with lobbyists, is the archetypal boogeyman mr. trump has attacked in his assault on washington insiders. mr. kander often finds trump and clinton supporters at his campaign events     people who fight among themselves, he said, even as they share support for him. “there are people who will choose to vote for donald trump because they want to shake up that conversation,” mr. kander said in an interview in st. louis. “they are not going to go to that next line on the ballot and vote for somebody who they know is exactly who donald trump is talking about. ” until 2004, missouri was an even more reliable presidential bellwether state than ohio. but growing homogeneity outside its larger cities has made it more reliably republican on the presidential level. still, it remains a state where voters have a tendency to pick democrats for other statewide offices. “the misconception about missouri is that it is a red state,” said ken warren, a professor of political science at st. louis university. “they don’t like democrats at the top of the ticket because they are seen as from out of town. but most of our statewide offices are held by democrats. ” it is a reality that mr. blunt seems to be just starting to confront, much to his party’s chagrin. “it’s a competitive race, like missouri races usually are,” he said in an interview at the local republican headquarters here, where he nibbled on a   bagel grabbed off a buffet, the sort of campaign sustenance typical of the exhausting final weeks on the road. “i’m confident of where we are. but not overly confident. ” as of   mr. blunt led mr. kander 46 percent to 44 percent, a    drop since august. democrats need to gain five seats to retake control of the senate     four if hillary clinton wins the presidency, which would give tim kaine, her vice president, a tiebreaking vote. both parties now, surprisingly, view missouri as a crucial state in that battle. “i’m the 51st vote,” mr. blunt warned a small group of female republican voters here on thursday, casting himself as the critical piece of a majority. “if mrs. clinton gets elected, the last place to have an impact on the court is the senate,” he said, referring to the united states supreme court. (it actually takes 60 votes to bring a supreme court nomination to the senate floor.) in an extremely costly year for senate races over all, missouri has become the     state, with $15 million in ads pouring into its race. two weeks after mr. kander’s   gun ad in september, political action committees and other outside groups dropped more than $8 million into the state on the two candidates, quadruple what they had spent in the previous two weeks, according to filings with the federal election commission. mr. kander has benefited from being a sui generis blend: at once, he is a   democrat, a veteran, a   lawyer who wears the outsider label, and the opponent of an incumbent who is the embodiment of washington longevity. he has focused on trying to turn mr. blunt’s experience into a liability. he has also homed in on the senator’s tangled family ties. mr. blunt’s wife is a lobbyist, and his three adult children are registered lobbyists as well. mr. kander’s ads and those of outside groups have suggested, among other things, that mr. blunt took votes to enrich industries that his family represented. for his part, mr. blunt and those groups supporting him have tried to cast mr. kander, who was a state representative before becoming secretary of state in 2013, as a toady for mrs. clinton and president obama, who are both unpopular here. one ad shows his face morphing into theirs with the tagline: “fresh face. same old liberal thinking. ” “senator blunt genuinely sees everything through the lens of partisan politics,” mr. kander said. (actually, mr. blunt is widely viewed as a consummate   in congress.) mr. kander’s military service is a boost, too, in a state with many veterans. mr. blunt’s draft deferments have also come up during the campaign, and he recently brought in another republican senator, joni ernst, who has served in the military, to support him at a veterans’ event. “  goes a long way here,” professor warren said. “superpatriotism is a big thing in missouri. ” missouri’s contest is indicative of the circumstances in many senate races. while mr. trump is weak in pennsylvania, for instance, the incumbent, senator patrick j. toomey, has managed to keep the race close by dint of his own record and a democratic candidate who has been less exciting than her party anticipated. at the same time, in a battle over an open seat in nevada, mr. trump has been a drag on the republican candidate, united states representative joe heck, not because mr. heck supports mr. trump but because his support for the republican nominee has waned. “in most cases trump is responsible” for republican weaknesses, said jennifer duffy, senior editor for the cook political report, “but there are quirky things going on. ” it is the sort of year that produces voters like michael brown, a vietnam veteran and conservative republican who came to a small   discussion last week with mr. kander in cape girardeau. mr. brown will not vote for mr. trump, he said, but remains undecided about the senate race. “this year is the toughest vote i’ve ever cast,” he said., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.384014\n",
      "(philadelphia     from the time donald j. trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional republicans treated his policy pronouncements     largely out of step with republican dogma     as essentially a distraction. he would talk. they would drive the policies. but now, the question of whether congressional republicans would change president trump or mr. trump would change them has an early answer. mr. trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in flint, mich. they also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that mr. trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5, 000 more border patrol agents. they have stayed oddly silent as mr. trump and senate democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from president barack obama. once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, republicans are now embracing mr. trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during mr. obama’s second term. speaker paul d. ryan, whose own website this week still praised the   partnership trade deal, now applauds mr. trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. many republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, mr. trump’s embrace of both. even on the subject of mr. trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, republicans have often demurred. “the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell of kentucky. mr. trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. “this congress is going to be the busiest congress we’ve had in decades, maybe ever,” mr. trump said. in an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, “we’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. you’re not wasting your time. ” many republicans in congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the obama administration’s decisions to halt the keystone xl and dakota access pipeline projects. “i think he’s completely winning the expectation game,” said representative peter roskam of illinois. “i think he’s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,” he said, adding, “it’s really remarkable. ” in one significant way, congressional republicans potentially seemed to pull mr. trump to their end of the policy pool. on thursday, the administration initially  appeared to endorse  taxing imports as a way to pay for the mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. but the white house later said it was just one option under consideration. “we are in a very good place on tax reform,” mr. ryan said. “it can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it’s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, i think most people agree that this is the right approach. ” congressional republicans are also struggling to keep up with mr. trump’s   announcements, let alone push their agenda. “it’s   stuff,” said senator john hoeven, republican of north dakota. investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see congress take on. “our priorities are the ones we laid out,” he said. they are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda     specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the affordable care act. “we are on the same page with the white house,” mr. ryan insisted thursday. “the president agrees with this agenda. ” but it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation. and the list is much longer. by contrast, last year, senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 senate republican, called democrats’ request for $600 million in aid to flint added to an energy bill “a huge earmark,” adding, “i think it’s not something i could support,” in keeping with most of his colleagues. republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight zika last year. the talk of a spending surge has left some republicans worried about an exploding deficit. “there are going to have to be some cuts,” said representative jason chaffetz of utah. “i am not interested in raising our spending levels. ” senator john barrasso of wyoming, the chairman of the environment and public works committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. “we’re a fiscally conservative group,” he said of the committee. “we’re going to want to see things paid for. ” republicans are also at times confused about what mr. trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on twitter. “‘appears’ i think is the big word,” said representative ryan costello of pennsylvania. “i don’t think anyone in the house of representatives on the republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,” only to have the trump administration send a bill back, he said. republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the house continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later. also notable is the republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised: the use of the executive pen to make policy. several house republicans dismissed the notion that mr. trump would abuse his power to issue executive orders in the way they complained that mr. obama did during his second term. “what you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,” said representative tom reed of new york. mr. trump is also trying to work his will on how the senate operates. in an interview with sean hannity on fox news, mr. trump said he thought mr. mcconnell should get rid of the senate filibuster rule for supreme court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick “obstructionists. ” about three blocks from where mr. trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from city hall to rally against the president. while the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. “i don’t trust anything he says,” said ken snyder, 62., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(york, pa.     senator patrick j. toomey, republican of pennsylvania, has never met charles kress, but he desperately needs him. mr. kress, 62, will vote for a democrat this november for the white house, he said, no matter what. he is also planning to vote for mr. toomey’s  . “sometimes you have to keep in office the ones who make the deals,” mr. kress said as he watered the flowers in front of york’s unitarian church. republican senators like mr. toomey who are running in swing states     about six, and enough to tip the balance of power in the senate     need voters who would reject donald j. trump to nonetheless pull the levers for the party’s other candidates in november. in some districts, house republicans will need them, too. mr. trump’s convincing sweep of the primaries in connecticut, delaware, maryland, pennsylvania and rhode island on tuesday did little to assuage concerns about his standing with swing voters in november. his victory speech included a bracing broadside against hillary clinton’s playing the “woman card. ” and he continues to trail his opponents, senator ted cruz of texas and gov. john kasich of ohio, among republican women. but   voters in federal races have become increasingly rare over the last two decades, hitting a low in 2012, when only 10 percent of them divided their votes between parties. that was down sharply from 1972. the ranks of   voters have expanded along with the rise in partisanship and its attendant rancor in congress. “there is no doubt that, over all, the era of polarization and   above and beyond idiosyncratic factors     that has to lead to a drop in ticket splitting,” said richard born, a professor of political science at vassar college and an expert on congressional elections. “democrats and republicans alike, as part of the polarization phenomenon, are more consistently liberal or conservative across issues,” mr. born said, “as are the candidates themselves, meaning less likelihood of ticket splitting. ” even in pennsylvania, a state that has elected a senator from a different party than the presidential candidate it chose seven times since world war ii, ticket splitting has decreased drastically in recent elections. “that is probably toomey’s worst problem,” said g. terry madonna, the director of the center for politics and public affairs at franklin and marshall college. it is also a problem for the republican senators kelly ayotte of new hampshire, ron johnson of wisconsin, mark s. kirk of illinois and rob portman of ohio. republicans in washington are increasingly worried for them. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader, and other republicans are openly urging elected officials in their party to focus largely on local issues and their role in bipartisan legislation, and to refrain from tying themselves to the top of the ticket should the nominee be mr. trump. “i think we have to go out and make a case,” said representative scott perry, a republican who represents the york area. “people don’t split their tickets because they don’t have a choice. it’s because they do. i think those people are going to need to be convinced. ” while a polarizing presidential candidate is considered very difficult for republican senators to overcome in swing states, there may be a silver lining for them. some republican donors are quietly plotting to dismiss mr. trump and instead pour their money into senate races where they believe republicans can be saved, as a check and balance to a democrat sitting in the white house for the next four years. “the prospect of trump at the top of the ticket could create an exodus of donors away from the presidential and toward senate and house races,” said kevin madden, a republican strategist. “the potential is there for a concentration of effort and resources geared toward senate races that chuck schumer and his senate democrats may not have been counting on. ” mr. schumer, a new yorker who is poised to become the next leader of the senate democrats, says good luck with that. “if there was ever a national election, this is it,” he said. “they can run from their nominee, but they can’t hide. ” ticket splitting over the last five decades has occurred most often among moderate democrats who have supported a republican for president but voted for democrats for congress. some voters have viewed this as a recipe for compromise and balance, while others have been repelled by the democratic candidates running for the top job. the three strongest years of ticket splitting between presidential and house voting in the last five decades, according to american national election studies survey data, were 1972, when 30 percent of voters did it 1980 (28 percent) and 1984 (26 percent). similar studies show the same trend for senate races. in all three of those elections, a republican won the white house by a landslide at a time when registered democrats significantly outnumbered republicans in the overall population, and when considerably more incumbent house members were democrats. the 1928 election provides a history lesson in what can happen when a candidate, rather than the political mood, drives ticket splitting. that year, al smith, the governor of new york, became the democratic nominee. it was not extreme rhetoric like mr. trump engages in, which has repelled some republicans, that held mr. smith back with voters. mr. smith was a roman catholic, opposed prohibition and was a symbol of modern urbanism. and that combination drove off rural and moderate southern democrats, who outnumbered republicans significantly, contributing to his loss to the republican herbert hoover. while republicans made a net gain of eight seats in the senate that year, demonstrating that ticket splitting does not help all senators attached to the party of a wildly unpopular candidate, many democrats still voted along party lines for the house and senate. in 1996, when it was clear that bill clinton would trounce bob dole, republicans encouraged voters to stick with their party in the down ballot, and newt gingrich, then speaker of the house, cautioned his members to distance themselves from mr. dole. mr. gingrich came up with a parallel house agenda much as speaker paul d. ryan is now doing, and he told members to run on it. “it saved the house and the senate for them,” said mr. born, the vassar professor. “trying to localize the campaigns paid off. ” but republican ticket splitters may make an alternative choice that is equally damaging to mr. toomey’s prospects. “i might just skip the whole thing,” said kristi peyton, 46, a toomey fan who offered her views of mr. trump     “disaster,” “bully” and “unattractive”     over crabs at captain bob’s in railroad, a small town near york. “where republicans can really get hurt is not so much that people vote democrat for congress but that they don’t show up at all,” mr. born said. “this is where the republicans are scared to death. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(tucson, ariz.     senator john mccain does not say much these days about donald j. trump’s attack on his   years as a prisoner of war. instead, he clenches his teeth and says he will support the republican party’s presumptive nominee, who once said derisively about the senator’s time in captivity, “i like people that weren’t captured. ” in the   swelter here in arizona, his home state, mr. mccain, who was the republicans’ presidential nominee and   in 2008, did not openly bemoan this moment from his long political life. he is focusing on what he considers his toughest   fight yet, and is betting that the only way to keep his seat is to support mr. trump. “i’m fair game. i’m in the arena,” said mr. mccain, 79, whose thinning face reflects the decades he has spent traveling around his massive and increasingly diverse state. still, the episode sits with traces of bitterness, like old coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup, even if he says otherwise. for a moment, the july attack on mr. mccain seemed to be mr. trump’s undoing. mccain said he recalled a recent chat with a world war ii veteran who had been in a german prison camp. as he delivered the man a missing medal, “he said to me, ‘why would trump say something like that about us?’ ” the senator said. “frankly, i didn’t have an answer for it. ” but mr. trump has since called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a wall at the mexican border, and now the billionaire businessman could be the force that ultimately topples the indomitable mr. mccain. an estimated 433, 000 hispanics are expected to vote in arizona this november, an 8 percent increase from 2012. and mr. mccain has a credible democratic challenger, representative ann kirkpatrick, who grew up on an indian reservation and has strong support from the state’s sizable native american population. “i just came from a latino round table, and they are really concerned about mccain’s support for trump,” she said tuesday. “it’s very personal here. ” she is working with the state’s democrats to harness these forces against mr. mccain and his old guard, which is largely behind mr. trump. ms. kirkpatrick said that being   “is a strong message,” but she acknowledged that “it’s not the only message. ” she recently opened a field office in tempe, and has many arizona state university volunteers working the phones. working out of an old bank, aides sit in the former vault (the door has been removed) to go over mr. mccain’s statements, year by year, and look for inconsistencies that suggest too long a stay in congress. “the race comes down to whether arizonans take a step back and judge john mccain for being john mccain and his remarkable life of public service,” said grant woods, a former state attorney general and the senator’s friend for decades. “and not as being a   incumbent, and not as a republican in a year when the party has a controversial nominee. if they do that, he will win walking away. if they don’t, then it could be tight. could he lose? yeah. ” despite the personal attacks by mr. trump on the senator’s integrity and war record, mr. mccain cannot afford to reject mr. trump and alienate his many supporters in arizona if he hopes to hold his seat, an agonizing  . mr. mccain is the embodiment of much that voters in both parties, but especially fans of mr. trump, have said they would like to jettison this year. he is the ultimate establishment player, having served in congress for nearly four decades     five terms in the senate alone. “back in the middle ages, i was known as the maverick,” mr. mccain said, smiling wanly. he is an unapologetic free trader, an interventionist abroad who continues to defend the deeply unpopular war in iraq, a supporter of private industry and markets, and the original, if inconstant, champion of changes to the immigration system that would help some illegal immigrants become citizens. to succeed in what most people believe will be his last political campaign, mr. mccain must canter around the state assuring mr. trump’s detractors that he does not share the businessman’s visions for mass deportation and the dissolution of nato, while continuing to woo an angry republican base that overwhelmingly voted for mr. trump in the state’s march primary. “i’ve been feeling it out there for some time,” mr. mccain said. “in the southern part of the state here, they are not feeling the recovery at all. then there is this whole issue with these young people and kids carrying around all this debt. ” “that’s the bernie effect,” he said, referring to senator bernie sanders’s youth appeal in the democratic primaries. he added: “the turmoil in this race is more than i’ve ever seen. younger, newer voters are registering for only one reason, to vote against trump. so my challenge is to convince that younger, newer voter that i am for them. ” his greater challenge may be with latinos angry at mr. trump. according to an analysis of voter and census data by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials educational fund, latinos are expected to account for 17 percent of arizona’s registered electorate this year, with a voter turnout rate at close to 70 percent. nearly 45 percent of latino registered voters are democrats, the report found. “i’ve always spent a lot of time with the hispanic community,” mr. mccain said, “but having said that, they are rising in numbers in the voting population. i’m putting more emphasis there, particularly in light of trump’s comments. ” hispanics in the phoenix area will also be heavily motivated to vote in the sheriff’s election joe arpaio, a trump supporter who was recently found in contempt of court for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining latinos, will be on the ballot, trying to keep his seat as maricopa county sheriff. a day watching mr. mccain campaign here this past week reflects his evolving challenges. he sat for the endorsement of a small group of border patrol agents, who have also endorsed mr. trump, and listened in silence as art del cueto, the president of tucson local 2455 of the national border patrol council, explained why mr. trump had gotten their approval. “it means so much to me this long relationship we’ve had,” mr. mccain said about his endorsement, “and the support we’ve tried to provide. ” mr. del cueto did say that “we did talk to donald” about his comments concerning mr. mccain’s war record. “i don’t think it was a comment that has been made again,” he said. but a bit later, meeting with hispanic business leaders, mr. mccain opened with “we’re going to make america great again and it’s going to be huge, o. k.?” it was a tiny swipe at mr. trump, taken in the manner of a toddler grabbing a cookie when he assumes no one is looking. then it was on to other topics, like the federal aviation administration reauthorization. mr. mccain remains most at home with other veterans, like the one he visited     on memorial day, another man waiting on medals. “his wife said he was staying alive to get those medals,” mr. mccain said, smiling at the memory. “sometimes it’s a nice job. ”,

      "(washington     the most powerful and ambitious   congress in 20 years will convene tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of american life     refashioning the country’s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the obama administration. even before   donald j. trump is sworn in on jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities     most notably a measure to clear a path for the affordable care act’s repeal. perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new congress is the push for deregulation. also up early: filling a   supreme court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for mr. trump’s cabinet nominees. “it’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,” said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader. “and we intend to do it. ” but as republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of congress for their more partisan goals, democrats are preparing roadblocks. the party’s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of russian election interference, mr. trump’s   cabinet picks and his taunting twitter posts. (on saturday, he offered new year’s wishes “to all,” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. ”) obstacles will also come from republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. and any burst of legislative action will come only if congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. for republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved     the house in particular has signaled the republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. but many of those measures have gathered dust in the senate or been doused in veto ink. the cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent house republican majority in the  . speaker newt gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the senate majority leader, bob dole, who stacked conservative house bills like so many fire logs in the back of the senate chamber. “they’ve been given a golden opportunity here,” said trent lott, the former republican senate majority leader. “but i have watched over the years when one party has had control of the white house and the senate and the house, and the danger is overplaying your hand. “if you go too far, like what happened with obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,” mr. lott continued. “you have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ” the tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the senate finance committee is already moving in that direction. still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from mr. trump’s chief of staff, reince priebus. the senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for mr. trump. republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. but on many issues, senate democrats     including their new leader, chuck schumer of new york     are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of mr. trump’s agenda. “after campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   trump’s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he’s sworn in,” said senator patty murray, democrat of washington. “democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ” republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that president obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the trump team on which ones should be undone. “i hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,” the house speaker, paul d. ryan of wisconsin, said at a recent forum. “i think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ” in late december, the obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. that regulation, one of dozens that mr. trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. but congress is likely to block it, using the obscure congressional review act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion. given time constraints on the senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. they are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. republicans will also move quickly to repeal the affordable care act. they plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year     already a quarter over     that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any democratic filibuster. but republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace mr. obama’s, and they may delay the repeal measure’s effective date for years. the senate must also consider mr. trump’s cabinet picks, and senate democrats are already trying to slow the process. however, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than supreme court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with mr. trump’s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. republicans have been particularly upset that senator jeff sessions of alabama, whom mr. trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with democrats on the senate judiciary committee or had meetings canceled. senator dianne feinstein of california postponed her meeting with mr. sessions until january because, she said, her schedule got too busy. “the senator doesn’t want to rush,” said her spokesman, tom mentzer. one reason that democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over mr. mcconnell’s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the supreme court nomination of judge merrick b. garland. lingering in the background is the specter of russia. democrats     and some republicans, who are at odds with mr. trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him     want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. the obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. while republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. “this is no time for hubris,” mr. mcconnell said. “you have to perform. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(a look at the political math in six states where tight races could determine control of the senate: north carolina senator richard burr, a republican, was thought to be a safe bet for   against deborah ross, his democratic challenger, who is a former state representative and head of the state’s chapter of the american civil liberties union. but north carolina has been roiled by a fight over bathroom rights for transgender people that has affected almost every campaign. the national republican party has swooped in to try to save mr. burr’s bid. _____ pennsylvania  katie mcginty, a democrat, is trying to become pennsylvania’s first female senator with a bid to unseat senator patrick j. toomey, a republican who has managed to keep a moderate image around the state because of a (failed) gun safety bill that bore his name. hillary clinton’s coattails     and donald j. trump’s anvil     have made a difference here. _____ new hampshire  senator kelly ayotte, a republican, is suffering from an uncomfortable association with mr. trump, most notably when she had to release a statement walking back her suggestion during a debate that mr. trump was a role model for children. gov. maggie hassan, her democratic challenger, is getting major assistance from national party figures like vice president joseph r. biden jr. and senator bernie sanders in what is widely viewed as the closest senate race in the country. _____ missouri senator roy d. blunt was on no lists of endangered incumbents. then his democratic challenger, jason kander, an afghanistan veteran who is missouri’s secretary of state, conjured up an ad in which he assembled an assault rifle blindfolded while speaking of gun rights. it was a clever way to both fend off attacks over gun control and underscore mr. blunt’s vietnam deferments in a very   state. mr. blunt’s decades of service in washington are also out of style this year. _____ indiana  evan bayh, a democrat, is trying to reclaim his senate seat but is finding that his time as a washington insider is a serious liability. representative todd young, with the help of millions of dollars in outside money, is painting a dark picture of mr. bayh as a greedy lobbyist who abandoned his voters, and mr. bayh’s   lead has shrunk significantly. indiana is trump country, and mr. bayh, who was once a very popular governor, is going to need republican voters who remember him fondly to split their tickets. _____ nevada for a while, it did not seem that catherine cortez masto, a democrat who is a former state attorney general, would catch up to representative joe heck, a republican who seemed a good fit for his state and this cycle. but mr. heck, by turning away from mr. trump after the presidential candidate was heard bragging about sexual assault in a 2005 recording, began to lose some of his base support, living every republican candidate’s nightmare. the hispanic vote, important here, is hard to poll. but ms. cortez masto is now narrowly ahead in the race, a battle for the seat of senator harry reid in which the retiring democratic leader has unleashed his political machine in support of her., Jennifer

      "(’’ ’yahoo ceo marissa mayer promised  the hip blogging site, when she acquired it for $1. 1 billion in 2013.’ ”but on tuesday, yahoo acknowledged that the acquisition hasn’t quite been the success it had hoped.” ”yahoo took a $230 million write down on tumblr and said that the site hadn’t met its revenue targets.” ’the write down was part of a hefty $4. 5 billion goodwill impairment that yahoo recorded  with much of the charges stemming from its businesses in the us, europe, canada and latin america. ’ ’yahoo noted that $3. 3 billion of the write downs were from acquisitions that occured before 2012, meaning that they were deals that were done before mayer was ceo. ’ ’yahoo cfo ken goldman said that tumblr had missed its 2015 revenue target, which called for the site to generate $100 million. ’ ”yahoo isn’t giving up on tumblr. in fact, tumblr is one of the three pillars that yahoo is building  as the company announced on tuesday. ” ’but the fact that it is writing down some of tumblr is an acknowledgment that the biggest and flashiest acquisition made by mayer has not lived up to expectations. ’, Alexei Oreskovic, 0)

      "(’  ’ ’   twitter, which was once a darling of the tech industry and went   public almost three years ago in an   ipo, . ’ ”   we’ve seen this story with an internet company before. ” ’   in fact, the parallels between twitter and yahoo are rather   striking: ’ ’   a rotating cast of ceos and executives with little   direction; a powerful platform once seen as the future of the   internet struggling with an identity crisis; questionable   strategies for growth. ’ ”   if it doesn’t sell soon, twitter risks setting itself up for   yahoo’s same fate: a   stagnation in which no   progress is made, and company focus and morale are slowly   drained by   takeover talks. the story ends   with a desperate sale for a tiny fraction of its peak   valuation. ” ”   right now, twitter seems to think it can fetch as much as   $30 billion in a sale, about double its market cap as of friday,   . yahoo,    agreed to sell to verizon for $4. 8 billion this year. that was   8 years after microsoft offered to buy yahoo for $42   billion     an offer that yahoo’s leadership stubbornly   rebuffed.  ” ”   if ceo jack dorsey and the twitter board pull a yahoo from 2008,   they’re setting themselves up for a . ” ”   twitter would also be taking a gamble if it doesn’t sell and   tries to make it on its own. as  one option the company is   considering other than a sale is a restructuring that could   include layoffs. but we’ve seen twitter go through that before,   and it hasn’t helped solve its user growth problems. as the   saying goes     and as yahoo proved through many rounds of layoffs   and endless restructurings     you can’t cut your way to   growth. ” ’  ’ ”   despite its many problems, twitter is still an attractive asset.   it’s an invaluable tool for news gatherers, celebrities, world   leaders, activists and marketers. it has a treasure trove of   untapped data, which probably looks pretty tasty to companies   like google and salesforce. twitter was the platform that a   reality tv    tycoon used to promote himself all   the way to the gop nomination for the presidency. no one can deny   the power and influence twitter wields, even with   its relatively small base of active users.  ” ”   but twitter’s company culture has always prided itself on being   fiercely independent. the company turned down an offer from   facebook in its early days. ” ”   and while cofounder dorsey doesn’t control a majority of   twitter’s voting shares (as facebook’s mark zuckerberg and   google’s larry page and sergey brin do) it’s not clear how   amenable dorsey might be to selling out     or how vigorously he   might try to oppose a deal. ” ”   depending on who the buyer is, an acquisition might not be at   odds with twitter’s mission. unlike yahoo, which seems   destined to be   for valuable resources and left   unrecognizable once verizon gains jurisdiction over it, twitter’s   service could actually flourish under a parent company that   provides additional resources and leeway.  ” ’  ’ ’     ’, Steve Kovach, 8)

      "(’  ’ ’   google held a splashy press event in san francisco on   tuesday to unveil  including a      phone called the pixel, a   virtual reality headset   called daydream view, an amazon echo competitor called google   home, and a home wifi system known as google wifi. ’ ”   unlike google’s past dalliances in hardware, this time all the   products are under one division, led by former motorola president   rick osterloh, and they seemed more coherently tied together than   ever before.  ” ’   for instance, google’’s intelligent agent, the google assistant,   shows up in both the wifi connected ”home” speaker and in the new   pixel phone, although you activate it slightly differently     with   home, you have to say ”okay google” every time, while the pixel   simply lets you press and hold the home software button. the   pixels are the first (and so far only) phones to work with the   daydream headset. you can get a daydream view and a base for   the home in the same   color called ”snow.” ’ ”   the products themselves also seemed solid when i tried them   in google’s demo area, although we haven’t had a chance to review   them independently. ” ’   the home smart speaker really does understand if you ask it to   ”play that smashmouth song from shrek,” or tell it to turn down   your nest thermostat     i was particularly impressed at how well   it picked up our voice commands in a crowded and noisy space. the   pixel looks as good as any other   smartphone. the   daydream view may make you look like a dork (like all   vr viewers) but it’’s got some smart design touches, like   the little cubby where you tuck the remote control, and it comes   in some cool colors and is covered with a pleasant soft fabric. ’ ’  ’ ”   all that aside, i still think google’s heart is elsewhere.   why? ” ”   perhaps most telling, when google ceo sundar pichai was talking   today, he didn’t show the kind of excitement   and energy he shows at google   the company’s annual   event for developers. pichai is a software developer; those are   his people. he was most animated during a long diversion   about about google’s machine learning prowess in translating   english to chinese     a tough problem, but a software engineering   problem, not a hardware problem.  ” ’  ’ ’   google hardware boss  on tuesday   that the company was serious about hardware this time and is in   it for the long haul. ’ ”   but in fact, the best part of these google hardware products   isn’t the hardware. it’s the software and services that underpin   them     the brains behind the google assistant, the unlimited   photo storage for the pixel provided by google’s cloud, the   daydream virtual reality platform that third parties will be able   to use to create 3d content. ” ”   so this is not google turning into apple. it’s   more akin to google following microsoft when it started   doing hardware in 2010 to help show what windows 8 was capable of   on touch screen devices. microsoft does take hardware seriously.   it has some excellent designers. it’s making some very   strong products and . ” ”   but it’s hardware in service of microsoft’s other products and   its broader strategy of productivity everywhere, not hardware for   its own sake. ” ”   that’s the template google is following. google’s broader   strategy is providing access to all the world’s information, and   selling advertisements against the attention consumers pay to get   that information. consumers or investors who think otherwise risk   confusion and disappointment. ”,

      "(’  ’ ’   after years of hype from the tech industry, we finally have a   smart home product that actually makes sense. ’ ”   wifi speakers like amazon’s echo and the new google home are     types of computers, letting you do many of the same   tasks you’re used to on a smartphone with just your voice. ” ’   both the echo and google home are excellent products. but you can   only pick one. so, which should you choose? ’ ”   let’s break it down. ” ”   the most disappointing thing about google home’s hardware is the   sound quality. it tends to be   which is annoying if   you want to listen to anything with some bass. ” ’   the echo has much better sound, including rich bass. ’ ’   neither speaker sounds amazing though. luckily, both have options   that let you connect them wirelessly to standard stereo systems.   for home, you can use the . for echo, you can use the . ’ ’winner: amazon echo ’ ’  ’ ”   both speakers have incredible voice recognition. it even works   when music is playing or you’re standing across the room. ” ’winner: tie ’ ’   this one is subjective, but i think google home looks better than   the echo. ’ ”   yes, home looks kind of like an air wick, but it’s also more   compact and has a more thoughtful design. the smaller size means   it’s easier to display, and the sloped top is a nice touch.   google could’ve just made a   canister, but home   has its own unique look that’ll match your home’s decor better.   plus, you can customize the design by swapping out the bottom   speaker grill with different colors. ” ”   the echo, on the other hand, isn’t much to look at. it’s just a   plain black or white cylinder that gives off a cold, industrial   vibe. the lights on top of the echo are a nice touch, but other   than that, it’s not nearly as inviting as home. ” ’winner: google home ’ ’   both speakers can do a lot of great stuff out of the box, but   things get even better when developers get to add their own apps   and services.  ’ ”   so far, there are limited options on google home. you can sync it   with popular music services like spotify or pandora. there’s also   uber integration. but you won’t find much more than that until   more developers are able to build on google home. ” ’   echo had over a year’’s head start on google home, and it has   hundreds of ”skills” from third parties ranging from capital one   to domino’’s pizza. it’’s definitely the stronger of the two   ecosystems. ’ ’winner: amazon echo ’ ’  ’ ’   this is the most important category, and the one that really   differentiates the two devices. ’ ”   while both google home and amazon echo have plenty of smarts,   google has the advantage here because it’s able to tap into the   search giant’s trove of knowledge and stitch together the various   google services you use like gmail and google calendar. all that   is thanks to the company’s new digital helper, google assistant,   which is only a few weeks old and already much more impressive   than amazon’s alexa or apple’s siri. ” ”   echo can sync with your google calendar and some other services,   but it’s simply not as refined as google assistant. and in the   future, i’m more confident in google’s ability to make     smarter, faster than amazon can make  . ” ’winner: google home ’ ’  ’ ’   while both devices are essentially on par with each other, i   think google home has a slight edge because of google assistant.   you want these devices to be as smart as possible, and google has   always had the advantage when it comes to ai and machine   learning. ’ ’   plus, at $129, google home is $50 cheaper than the amazon echo. ’ ’   if you want to buy a connected speaker, check out google home   first. ’ ”   just because i think google home is better doesn’t mean you   should abandon your echo if you already own one. it’s still an   incredible device. in fact, i plan on keeping my echo instead of   replacing it with a google home. it’s that good. ”, Steve

      "(’  ’ ’   over four years ago, google launched a bold evolution of search   called google now. google now wasn’t the search you were used to.   instead of a list of results to your queries, you got the single   answer you were looking for. ’ ’   how old is barack obama? what time is the super bowl? when was   the last time the mets won the world series? ’ ’   you always got the answer. ’ ’   and even better, google now was proactive, bringing you the   information you wanted before you even knew you wanted it. your   flight is delayed. traffic is bad, so you’d better leave a few   minutes early if you want to make it to work on time. your   favorite team lost again. ’ ’   google now felt like the future at a time when apple was still   trying to get siri to understand you when you asked it 2+2. ’ ’   on tuesday, google kicked it into high gear. ’ ’   at its big product launch event, google now officially became     with google assistant, the next evolution of its   ai. ’ ’   we got an early look at assistant in  google’s new messaging app that launched a few weeks   ago, but tuesday’s event showed us google’s true vision for its   new ai helper. assistant will be everywhere, helping you out no   matter what gadget or app you’re using. ’ ’   and according to google ceo sundar pichai, it’ll keep getting   smarter the more you use it, to the point that it’ll be so   customized to the user that there will be a unique google   assistant for everyone. ’ ’   it may not be a new idea     all the major tech companies from   microsoft to amazon to facebook have their own ai assistants       but it is a category google is uniquely qualified to dominate. ’ ’  ’ ’   after all these years, google continues to embarrass the   competition. while assistant can tap into the world’s knowledge,   siri struggles to answer even the simplest queries. i recently   asked both ais when tuesday’s vice presidential debates start.   google assistant told me 9 p. m. eastern. siri gave me a list of   search results about the election from bing. that’s just one   example, but if you use google assistant often enough, you   realize just how far ahead it is. ’ ’   then there’s the new google home speaker, a competitor to   amazon’s surprise hit echo speaker. while the echo is a great   device, google’s demo of home already felt ahead of what amazon   has pulled off so far. of course, it can play music and control   smart appliances. but it also intelligently answers questions   better than amazon’s alexa. and overall, echo can’t do half of   the things we saw home do on tuesday. ’ ’   google has literally built a multibillion dollar business on its   ability to answer questions. (pichai said tuesday google’s   knowledge graph is loaded with a growing library of 70 billion   facts.) now it’s focusing that expertise on ai that will be with   you no matter where you are. your home. your car. your phone. and   soon, everywhere else. ’ ’   the ai assistant race is the next major battle in personal   computing, and assistant is the first step towards that       computer. it already wipes the   floor with the competition, and it’s tough to see how anyone else   can keep up. ’, Steve Kovach, 8)

      "(washington     he didn’t see it coming. speaker paul d. ryan was in a hotel room in cincinnati last may when he learned that donald j. trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the republican nomination for president. mr. trump had recently lost the wisconsin primary, which mr. ryan and other republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. senator ted cruz of texas had made strides, and mr. ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. but he badly miscalculated. the ensuing path, from mr. trump’s securing the nomination to mr. ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in wisconsin a month before election day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that mr. trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. mr. ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of reince priebus, chairman of the republican national committee and a fellow wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to mr. trump. now, mr. ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve republican control of congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. if mr. trump is defeated on nov. 8     as mr. ryan has all but conceded     but republicans maintain their house majority, it will fall largely to mr. ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. there is, of course, the question of whether house members would let him do so. the republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the house decision on whether the speaker should be mr. ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies trumpism. democrats have moved quickly to paint mr. ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of mr. trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying mr. ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. on saturday, mr. ryan’s office added to that criticism of mr. trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for mr. ryan. for his part, mr. trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of mr. ryan. last week, in a series of twitter posts, he called mr. ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee. ” for now, the speaker spends his days treating mr. trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of hillary clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered house republicans. “right now his objective is crystal clear,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma, “to retain the republican majority in the house. in that effort he has helped members of the freedom caucus as well as those in the tuesday group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “we will worry about our internal differences after the election. right now we are in a bar fight and every republican is worth saving. ” that mr. ryan and mr. trump were never natural allies is understandable. they had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the white house, an encounter at a   in new york during the 2012 campaign. mr. ryan was mitt romney’s running mate. their paths would not cross again. “trump really wasn’t on paul’s radar screen,” said a. mark neuman, a ryan friend for two decades. “before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that mr. trump did not share mr. ryan’s passions for the green bay packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and midwest life with children. the relationship showed strains from the start, with mr. ryan alarmed by mr. trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. the speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to mr. trump for other republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “if we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. he made calls to several of the republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda mr. trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (the trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. mr. ryan also declined to be interviewed.) mr. ryan had hoped that mr. trump would eventually embrace his plan. when mr. trump clinched the nomination in may, mr. ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “the conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘don’t worry, this will end,’” said charlie sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in milwaukee and a friend of mr. ryan’s. “so it was a huge shock. i think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” with campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, mr. ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse mr. trump. none of this pleased mr. priebus, who prided himself on building the modern republican party in wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against mrs. clinton. in text messages and phone calls, mr. priebus tried to persuade mr. ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept mr. trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. mr. trump would yell at mr. priebus and in turn mr. priebus would needle mr. ryan. when that did not work, mr. trump claimed mr. ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to capitol hill to try to woo fellow republicans, a claim mr. ryan viewed as a serious breach. “that was the first realization that trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate mr. trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” in june, after a period of relative silence on mr. trump’s part, mr. ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. staff members of both men began to coordinate for the republican national convention. but days later mr. ryan aggressively criticized mr. trump for his remarks about a hispanic judge. another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “he was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” mr. sykes said. a bright spot came in july, when mr. trump chose indiana’s governor, mike pence, who has long been close to mr. ryan, as his running mate. privately, mr. pence tried to assure skeptical republicans that he would impose mr. ryan’s policy agenda if he and mr. trump captured the white house. then in august, mr. trump toyed with endorsing mr. ryan’s opponent in a primary. mr. ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. he watched mr. trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. mr. trump called mr. ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of mr. pence, and to seek debate advice, which mr. ryan said focused on preparation. (not heeded.) by the fall, mr. ryan had basically stopped speaking mr. trump’s name. the nominee made a request through the r. n. c. to campaign with mr. ryan, whose team agreed to invite mr. trump and mr. pence to an event this month in wisconsin. then came the tape of mr. trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. mr. sykes let mr. priebus know via text that mr. trump was no longer welcome in wisconsin. mr. sykes said mr. priebus responded: “i am the guy trying to fix this! i am in tears over this. ’” (a spokeswoman for mr. priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) mr. ryan agonized over his options. ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “i think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, who has renounced mr. trump. “his job is to help house republicans. period. ” mr. ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support mr. trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “we knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” mr. sykes said. “how much damage could they do?”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)    0.298214\n",

      "(’  ’ ’   marissa mayer was not able to turn yahoo into a thriving   independent company, as  a fraction of its peak price. ’ ’   but she did wonders for employees who worked there, according to   a former manager. ’ ”   jelena woehr, now the community director at flipagram,  that employees at yahoo were so cynical   before mayer took over that they didn’t trust her when she   introduced free food in the cafeteria. ” ’   thinking that it was just a temporary perk, they hoarded   everything they could get their hands on (emphasis hers): ’ ’’ ’   woehr praises mayer for turning that low     around by really listening to    employees. for   instance, she recounts how mayer answered her email at   1 a. m. when mayer was home with a newborn baby, and how she hung   out on an internal chat channel where people loved to complain,   but never once disciplined anybody who brought up a problem   there. ’ ’  ’ ”   it’s a stark but useful tale about what it’s like to work at a   company

      "(’  ’ ’   twitter, which was once a darling of the tech industry and went   public almost three years ago in an   ipo, . ’ ”   we’ve seen this story with an internet company before. ” ’   in fact, the parallels between twitter and yahoo are rather   striking: ’ ’   a rotating cast of ceos and executives with little   direction; a powerful platform once seen as the future of the   internet struggling with an identity crisis; questionable   strategies for growth. ’ ”   if it doesn’t sell soon, twitter risks setting itself up for   yahoo’s same fate: a   stagnation in which no   progress is made, and company focus and morale are slowly   drained by   takeover talks. the story ends   with a desperate sale for a tiny fraction of its peak   valuation. ” ”   right now, twitter seems to think it can fetch as much as   $30 billion in a sale, about double its market cap as of friday,   . yahoo,    agreed to sell to verizon for $4. 8 billion this year. that was   8 years after microsoft offered to buy yahoo for $42   billion     an offer that yahoo’s leadership stubbornly   rebuffed.  ” ”   if ceo jack dorsey and the twitter board pull a yahoo from 2008,   they’re setting themselves up for a . ” ”   twitter would also be taking a gamble if it doesn’t sell and   tries to make it on its own. as  one option the company is   considering other than a sale is a restructuring that could   include layoffs. but we’ve seen twitter go through that before,   and it hasn’t helped solve its user growth problems. as the   saying goes     and as yahoo proved through many rounds of layoffs   and endless restructurings     you can’t cut your way to   growth. ” ’  ’ ”   despite its many problems, twitter is still an attractive asset.   it’s an invaluable tool for news gatherers, celebrities, world   leaders, activists and marketers. it has a treasure trove of   untapped data, which probably looks pretty tasty to companies   like google and salesforce. twitter was the platform that a   reality tv    tycoon used to promote himself all   the way to the gop nomination for the presidency. no one can deny   the power and influence twitter wields, even with   its relatively small base of active users.  ” ”   but twitter’s company culture has always prided itself on being   fiercely independent. the company turned down an offer from   facebook in its early days. ” ”   and while cofounder dorsey doesn’t control a majority of   twitter’s voting shares (as facebook’s mark zuckerberg and   google’s larry page and sergey brin do) it’s not clear how   amenable dorsey might be to selling out     or how vigorously he   might try to oppose a deal. ” ”   depending on who the buyer is, an acquisition might not be at   odds with twitter’s mission. unlike yahoo, which seems   destined to be   for valuable resources and left   unrecognizable once verizon gains jurisdiction over it, twitter’s   service could actually flourish under a parent company that   provides additional resources and leeway.  ” ’  ’ ’     ’, Steve Kovach, 8)

      "( (cnn) us intelligence agencies released on friday an alarming report about a hostile foreign country’s efforts to subvert america’s system of government, and the incoming president does not seem to understand the danger of the situation. in a   document, the country’s top intelligence experts declared that russian president vladimir putin ordered a campaign to influence the us presidential election. ”russia’s goals,” they concluded, ”were to undermine public faith in the us democratic process, denigrate secretary clinton, and harm her electability.”  this is an extraordinary accusation, and the intelligence chiefs are fully aware of that. it is not a     spying operation: it was a plot aimed at corroding the foundation of america’s system of government and    as the report puts it    upending ”the   liberal democratic order.” that means that russia’s objectives, despite trump’s victory, have not been fully achieved.   if that were not enough reason for alarm, trump’s reaction shows he either doesn’t comprehend the seriousness of the matter, he does not care or, perhaps, as some have suggested, he’s not committed to america’s democracy. in fact, it seems that the   is only able to view the issue through his  . somehow, he cannot look beyond the impact this has on his image as the winner of the election. that   view is in sharp contrast with republicans (and democrats) in congress who have managed to rise above partisanship to face up to what has just happened. while republican sen. john mccain called russia’s actions  ”an act of war,” and house speaker paul ryan, also a republican, acknowledged  that russia ”clearly tried to meddle in our political system,” trump is caught in his solipsistic house of mirrors.  just before receiving a classified briefing on the intelligence, the   gave a telephone interview to the new york times in which he belittled the significance what occurred and called the commotion surrounding the findings of russia’s hacking and other activities a political witch hunt by democrats embarrassed by their election loss.  after he was briefed by the intelligence chiefs, he accepted the possibility of a russian hack, but grudgingly and with no appearance that he grasped the magnitude and significance of what occurred. he released a statement saying he and the intelligence briefers had a ”constructive meeting,” but his statement’s principal thrust was the claim that, ”there was absolutely no effect on the [election] outcome whatsoever,” and no tampering with voting machines. huh? clearly, trump misses the point. this is not about him it is about protecting the country he has been elected to govern from an active and deliberate threat. in his statement, trump vowed to get tough on hacking from various countries, but did not indicate he viewed russia as the culprit in the election interference operation. the russian interference campaign, as it happens, was not just hacking, even if actions by russian and   hackers played a major part in the operation. russia’s activities    which we have seen targeting other western democracies    included a vast array of techniques.  hacking the democratic national committee and clinton campaign chief john podesta’s emails were important elements of the russian efforts. the report shows how the hack was carried out and how the documents were handed to wikileaks for dissemination. ”moscow’s influence campaign,” as the intelligence report calls it, blended a variety of means, including covert cyberactivity by russian intelligence operatives, along with ”with overt   media,   intermediaries, and paid social media users or ’trolls’.”  and there was trump himself, who peddled the material to his followers, making it sound as if the hacks contained truly explosive information.  all those clinton emails, in fact, were the least of it. few people read them, but many people believed the claim that they contained great and horrifying secrets.   the greater effort was in painting clinton as unfit to lead. putin, as we wrote months ago and as us intelligence experts concluded, ”developed a clear preference” for trump over clinton. when he thought clinton would win despite russia’s multipronged effort to cast doubt on her, the plan shifted to undercutting the credibility of the election.  the report says   government bloggers were all set to launch a #democracyrip campaign after a clinton win, to undercut the election’s credibility. curiously, trump had also strongly suggested that if he lost it would be because of fraud. putin made a big push to help trump win. he deployed his ”news” agencies, rt and sputnik, along with a vast social media machine to promote false accusations that clinton was corrupt, ill, mentally unstable and linked to islamist groups. as it happens, trump did the same, promoting precisely that unfounded description of his rival, all the way to electoral victory.  the looming question is what, if anything, trump will do to stop this russian assault on democracy. will he carry on his plan to repair relations with the kremlin without taking any action? will he lift the modest sanctions just imposed by president barack obama? trump concluded his statement today saying, ”america’s safety and security will be my number one priority.” what is not clear is whether american democracy is also a priority. the   is playing a risky game by downplaying this matter and resisting the intelligence community’s conclusions. even before he takes office, the issue has already opened a rift with fellow republicans, and it has raised piercing questions that he cannot afford to ignore.  as democratic whip steny hoyer said, trump’s continued  denial of russia’s intervention in the election, ”would raise questions about where his sympathies truly lie.”, Frida Ghitis, 2)    0.108657\n",
      "( (cnn) though donald trump and vladimir putin seem to agree on a number of issues, there is one they apparently don’t see eye to eye on. while trump argues that hillary clinton is too weak to be president of the united states, the russian president appears to be genuinely afraid of clinton. evidence is growing that russia is actively working to undermine clinton’s presidential prospects. when hackers released the emails of the democratic national committee just hours before the democratic national convention, internet security specialists found the fingerprints of russian agencies. then came the latest hacks of clinton campaign chairman john podesta.  the us government has now formally accused russia of interfering in the us elections, and every instance of interference so far is clearly aimed at harming the democratic candidate.  it’s easy to see why putin fears clinton. while the trump campaign is trying to get voters to focus on clinton stumbling and coughing, putin sees her as a real threat to his objectives. for putin, stopping clinton is not only an important strategic goal. it is also personal.  back in 2011, putin faced the biggest protests the country had seen since the collapse of the soviet union. he had served two terms as president, the maximum allowed, and in 2008 had become prime minister, in a maneuver that allowed him to effectively hold power while his ally, dmitry medvedev, was president. then he announced    to much anger, but little surprise    that he would seek a third term as president. three months later, the opposition erupted in fury when his party won a landslide victory in legislative elections amid allegations of fraud. despite the frigid moscow temperatures, thousands massed in the streets calling for fair elections and for an end to putin’s seemingly endless rule. signs and chants declared, ”putin is a thief!” putin’s hold on power faced a genuine threat.   of state clinton openly sided with the protesters. ”the russian people, like people everywhere,” she said, ”. ..deserve free, fair, transparent elections.” putin was fuming. he blamed the protests on clinton, accusing her of sending ”a signal” to the opposition. putin’s personal animosity toward clinton coincides with his larger strategic goals. in recent years, he has launched an increasingly muscular foreign (and domestic) policy. he is challenging the us, nato and the european union at every turn. despite a shrinking economy    not much bigger than mexico’s    russia has used its military power to make it a major player on the global stage. russia, according to western analysts, has mounted a campaign to ”discredit the west’s liberal democratic model, and undermine   ties,” manipulating eastern european countries and ”supporting the far right” against the eu. that ”kremlin playbook” includes tampering with elections in europe and the us. clinton stands in direct defiance to putin’s vision, already partly in place, of a russia with a sphere of influence that includes the former soviet territory and, more loosely, eastern europe, alongside a weakened europe, us and nato. in contrast to trump, she has made countless comments over the years to suggest she would present a much tougher opponent to putin’s ambitions than barack obama has been, saying she thinks the united states must find ways to ”confine, contain, [and] deter russian aggression in europe and beyond.”  while clinton looks poised to toughen america’s stance, trump’s foreign policy coincides with russia’s. he has suggested he might recognize russia’s annexation of crimea, which putin captured by force from ukraine he might suspend economic sanctions against russia and would align his policies in syria with putin and assad. during the republican primaries, clinton came under fire for leading the obama administration’s failed diplomatic ”reset” with russia. but the former us ambassador to moscow, mike mcfaul, said she was deeply skeptical that the plan would bear fruit.  once out of office, her criticism of russia became cutting. when putin justified russia’s 2014 takeover of crimea as an effort to protect russian minorities there, clinton said it was reminiscent of hitler’s justification for taking over parts of eastern europe. putin later commented that clinton has ”never been too graceful in her statements.” clinton was implicitly critical of obama’s restrained response, saying, ”i am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of crimea and the continuing destabilization of ukraine.”  and just as putin targeted her by name, she, too, has gone after him personally. in a speech last year, she said, ”i remain convinced that we need a concerted effort to really up the costs on russia and in particular on putin.” the most urgent item on the foreign policy agenda for both the united states and russia is the civil war in syria. there, the trump campaign has offered conflicting ideas, but in the most recent debate trump seemed to stand with putin.  while obama has maintained an extremely restrained approach to the crisis, sending secretary of state john kerry to multiple, so far useless, diplomatic marathons with his russian counterpart even as russia continues bombing civilians in support of assad, clinton sounds determined to impose a   zone, which would defy not only syria’s army but also russia. she says she would keep the russians informed, so no clashes occur, adding ”i want them at the table,” but it is a sharp departure from the current policy, and one that must sound deeply disturbing to putin. a few years ago, putin mused, speaking about clinton, that ”it’s better not to argue with women.” it’s clear now why he’s going to great lengths to avoid having to argue with a president hillary clinton.   , Frida Ghitis, 2)       0.103295\n",

      "(washington     when donald j. trump goes low, congressional republicans go quiet. their tolerance of mr. trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for  . but on one point, all sides agree: they have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. and mr. trump’s provocations are making the republicans’ control of the senate, perhaps even the house, more tenuous. many republicans, even those whose contempt for mr. trump matches their ill will for president obama, still view the choice between mr. trump and hillary clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. they believe that mr. trump, guided by a   congress, will break their way more than mrs. clinton ever would. for others, the vacancy on the supreme court     and its potential to reshape the high court’s rulings for years     overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee’s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts. “the supreme court is probably the choice that will have the single most   effect on the nation,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, where mr. trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly republican state. congressional republicans who are up for       especially the handful like senators john mccain of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire who still face primaries     have made a basic calculation. they have criticized mr. trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. and party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and mr. trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities. alienating mr. trump’s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. their fears at this point appear justified. a poll conducted the last week of july by cbs news found that support for mr. trump among republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent. so the leaders largely responded to mr. trump’s attacks with feigned indifference. “republican elected officials are in a tough spot,” said nathan l. gonzales, the editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report, a nonpartisan newsletter. “they are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. some republicans are reluctant to attack donald trump because they’d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries. ” mr. trump pointedly declined on tuesday to endorse speaker paul d. ryan, the nation’s   elected republican, and verged on outright opposition to mr. mccain and ms. ayotte, just hours after mr. obama challenged republicans to denounce their nominee. both mr. obama and mr. trump have put republicans into an untenable position: criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for       but sitting idly as mr. trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters. “if you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?” mr. obama asked during a news conference on tuesday. mr. ryan’s spokesman tersely responded that the speaker had never sought mr. trump’s endorsement, and ms. ayotte more or less brushed off the matter, saying, “i call it like i see it,” in reference to her defense of a fallen army captain whose family mr. trump had derided. while many republicans are hoping for ticket splitters     those who might vote democrat for president but republican on the rest of the ticket     the parsing is all the more difficult. many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. “in 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,” said fergus cullen, a former chairman of the new hampshire republican party. “it was not like passover, where the door was marked, ‘this one should be spared.’ no, the angel of death came in and said no ‘let’s kill them all.’ ” it is not just a question of individual desires to win       although that certainly drives many of the statements about mr. trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. republicans believe they need to maintain the house and the senate, through a   blend of votes from their base and   split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda. “the speaker’s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,” said kevin madden, a republican operative who once worked for former speaker john a. boehner. “the political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms. ” republican leaders also know that in an   election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the washington establishment. this was the lesson senator ted cruz of texas learned when he was booed from the stage at the republican convention last month for declining to get behind mr. trump, and accounts for some of the heat that senator ben sasse of nebraska, a founder of the never trump movement, has taken from his party back home this year. then, there is the vehement opposition to mrs. clinton, especially how they view her role in the benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among republicans. “i happen to think that lying to the american people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of donald trump,” said mr. chaffetz, the chairman of the house oversight committee. he added: “nothing united republicans more than hillary clinton. ” some still may pull away. on tuesday, representative richard hanna, republican of new york, said he would endorse mrs. clinton for president, calling mr. trump “unfit to serve. ” but mr. hanna is not representative of the broader republican conference. “he came to congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,” mr. gonzales said. “he would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek  . but since he’s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what’s on his mind. ” but if mr. trump falls in the polls and republicans running for   start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for   voters, mr. hanna might not be alone., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(philadelphia     from the time donald j. trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional republicans treated his policy pronouncements     largely out of step with republican dogma     as essentially a distraction. he would talk. they would drive the policies. but now, the question of whether congressional republicans would change president trump or mr. trump would change them has an early answer. mr. trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in flint, mich. they also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that mr. trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5, 000 more border patrol agents. they have stayed oddly silent as mr. trump and senate democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from president barack obama. once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, republicans are now embracing mr. trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during mr. obama’s second term. speaker paul d. ryan, whose own website this week still praised the   partnership trade deal, now applauds mr. trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. many republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, mr. trump’s embrace of both. even on the subject of mr. trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, republicans have often demurred. “the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell of kentucky. mr. trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. “this congress is going to be the busiest congress we’ve had in decades, maybe ever,” mr. trump said. in an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, “we’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. you’re not wasting your time. ” many republicans in congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the obama administration’s decisions to halt the keystone xl and dakota access pipeline projects. “i think he’s completely winning the expectation game,” said representative peter roskam of illinois. “i think he’s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,” he said, adding, “it’s really remarkable. ” in one significant way, congressional republicans potentially seemed to pull mr. trump to their end of the policy pool. on thursday, the administration initially  appeared to endorse  taxing imports as a way to pay for the mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. but the white house later said it was just one option under consideration. “we are in a very good place on tax reform,” mr. ryan said. “it can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it’s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, i think most people agree that this is the right approach. ” congressional republicans are also struggling to keep up with mr. trump’s   announcements, let alone push their agenda. “it’s   stuff,” said senator john hoeven, republican of north dakota. investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see congress take on. “our priorities are the ones we laid out,” he said. they are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda     specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the affordable care act. “we are on the same page with the white house,” mr. ryan insisted thursday. “the president agrees with this agenda. ” but it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation. and the list is much longer. by contrast, last year, senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 senate republican, called democrats’ request for $600 million in aid to flint added to an energy bill “a huge earmark,” adding, “i think it’s not something i could support,” in keeping with most of his colleagues. republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight zika last year. the talk of a spending surge has left some republicans worried about an exploding deficit. “there are going to have to be some cuts,” said representative jason chaffetz of utah. “i am not interested in raising our spending levels. ” senator john barrasso of wyoming, the chairman of the environment and public works committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. “we’re a fiscally conservative group,” he said of the committee. “we’re going to want to see things paid for. ” republicans are also at times confused about what mr. trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on twitter. “‘appears’ i think is the big word,” said representative ryan costello of pennsylvania. “i don’t think anyone in the house of representatives on the republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,” only to have the trump administration send a bill back, he said. republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the house continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later. also notable is the republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised: the use of the executive pen to make policy. several house republicans dismissed the notion that mr. trump would abuse his power to issue executive orders in the way they complained that mr. obama did during his second term. “what you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,” said representative tom reed of new york. mr. trump is also trying to work his will on how the senate operates. in an interview with sean hannity on fox news, mr. trump said he thought mr. mcconnell should get rid of the senate filibuster rule for supreme court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick “obstructionists. ” about three blocks from where mr. trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from city hall to rally against the president. while the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. “i don’t trust anything he says,” said ken snyder, 62., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     he didn’t see it coming. speaker paul d. ryan was in a hotel room in cincinnati last may when he learned that donald j. trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the republican nomination for president. mr. trump had recently lost the wisconsin primary, which mr. ryan and other republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. senator ted cruz of texas had made strides, and mr. ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. but he badly miscalculated. the ensuing path, from mr. trump’s securing the nomination to mr. ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in wisconsin a month before election day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that mr. trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. mr. ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of reince priebus, chairman of the republican national committee and a fellow wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to mr. trump. now, mr. ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve republican control of congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. if mr. trump is defeated on nov. 8     as mr. ryan has all but conceded     but republicans maintain their house majority, it will fall largely to mr. ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. there is, of course, the question of whether house members would let him do so. the republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the house decision on whether the speaker should be mr. ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies trumpism. democrats have moved quickly to paint mr. ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of mr. trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying mr. ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. on saturday, mr. ryan’s office added to that criticism of mr. trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for mr. ryan. for his part, mr. trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of mr. ryan. last week, in a series of twitter posts, he called mr. ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee. ” for now, the speaker spends his days treating mr. trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of hillary clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered house republicans. “right now his objective is crystal clear,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma, “to retain the republican majority in the house. in that effort he has helped members of the freedom caucus as well as those in the tuesday group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “we will worry about our internal differences after the election. right now we are in a bar fight and every republican is worth saving. ” that mr. ryan and mr. trump were never natural allies is understandable. they had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the white house, an encounter at a   in new york during the 2012 campaign. mr. ryan was mitt romney’s running mate. their paths would not cross again. “trump really wasn’t on paul’s radar screen,” said a. mark neuman, a ryan friend for two decades. “before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that mr. trump did not share mr. ryan’s passions for the green bay packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and midwest life with children. the relationship showed strains from the start, with mr. ryan alarmed by mr. trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. the speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to mr. trump for other republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “if we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. he made calls to several of the republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda mr. trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (the trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. mr. ryan also declined to be interviewed.) mr. ryan had hoped that mr. trump would eventually embrace his plan. when mr. trump clinched the nomination in may, mr. ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “the conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘don’t worry, this will end,’” said charlie sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in milwaukee and a friend of mr. ryan’s. “so it was a huge shock. i think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” with campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, mr. ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse mr. trump. none of this pleased mr. priebus, who prided himself on building the modern republican party in wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against mrs. clinton. in text messages and phone calls, mr. priebus tried to persuade mr. ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept mr. trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. mr. trump would yell at mr. priebus and in turn mr. priebus would needle mr. ryan. when that did not work, mr. trump claimed mr. ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to capitol hill to try to woo fellow republicans, a claim mr. ryan viewed as a serious breach. “that was the first realization that trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate mr. trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” in june, after a period of relative silence on mr. trump’s part, mr. ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. staff members of both men began to coordinate for the republican national convention. but days later mr. ryan aggressively criticized mr. trump for his remarks about a hispanic judge. another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “he was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” mr. sykes said. a bright spot came in july, when mr. trump chose indiana’s governor, mike pence, who has long been close to mr. ryan, as his running mate. privately, mr. pence tried to assure skeptical republicans that he would impose mr. ryan’s policy agenda if he and mr. trump captured the white house. then in august, mr. trump toyed with endorsing mr. ryan’s opponent in a primary. mr. ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. he watched mr. trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. mr. trump called mr. ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of mr. pence, and to seek debate advice, which mr. ryan said focused on preparation. (not heeded.) by the fall, mr. ryan had basically stopped speaking mr. trump’s name. the nominee made a request through the r. n. c. to campaign with mr. ryan, whose team agreed to invite mr. trump and mr. pence to an event this month in wisconsin. then came the tape of mr. trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. mr. sykes let mr. priebus know via text that mr. trump was no longer welcome in wisconsin. mr. sykes said mr. priebus responded: “i am the guy trying to fix this! i am in tears over this. ’” (a spokeswoman for mr. priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) mr. ryan agonized over his options. ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “i think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, who has renounced mr. trump. “his job is to help house republicans. period. ” mr. ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support mr. trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “we knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” mr. sykes said. “how much damage could they do?”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)    0.535519\n",

      "(washington     house republican leaders signaled on monday that they would not support   donald j. trump’s threat to impose a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas, the first significant confrontation over the conservative economic orthodoxy that mr. trump relishes trampling. “i don’t want to get into some kind of trade war,” representative kevin mccarthy, republican of california and majority leader, told reporters in response to mr. trump’s threats over the weekend to seek a 35 percent import tariff on goods sold by united states companies that move jobs overseas and displace american workers. speaker paul d. ryan also pushed back against mr. trump on monday in an interview with a wisconsin reporter, saying an overhaul of the corporate tax code would more effectively keep companies in the united states than tax penalties. “i think we can get at the goal here,” he said, “which is to keep american businesses american, build things in america and sell them overseas     that can be properly addressed with comprehensive tax reform. ” mr. trump’s economic positions clashed with traditional conservatives during the campaign, but now these differences     on trade, government spending on infrastructure, and tax policies     have set the incoming president on a perilous course with the lawmakers whose support he needs to keep his agenda on track. “there will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 percent for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, a. c. units etc. back across the border,” mr. trump said in a series of twitter messages over the weekend. the response from republican leaders underscored the limits of legislating 140 characters at a time on twitter, and gave democrats cause to believe they can work with mr. trump to outmaneuver congressional republicans next year. “the   won in part by campaigning against the republican establishment on many economic issues,” said senator chuck schumer of new york, the incoming democratic leader. “if he wants to get something done for working families in this country, he’ll have to stand up to them when it comes time to govern, too. ” mr. trump first startled republicans during the campaign when he attacked trade deals, putting himself more in line with senator bernie sanders of vermont than mr. ryan. he repeatedly insisted that trade deals had displaced american workers and harmed the economy, upending two centuries of american economic policies that held trade up as a good thing, a position that republicans have pushed in recent decades. his positions helped imperil president obama’s trade pact with asian nations, the   partnership, and abruptly stop further trade negotiations, which many experts in both parties believe limits the united states in its economic position against china, especially when paired with tariff threats. “i respect   trump for fulfilling his campaign promise to withdraw from t. p. p. ,” representative kevin brady, republican of texas and chairman of the powerful house ways and means committee, said shortly after the election. “we can’t abandon these markets to china and other competitors, because american businesses and customers will lose out,” he added. mr. trump made republicans bend to his will     and against their   opposition to picking “winners and losers” in the economy     even before his inauguration when he announced last month that the     manufacturer carrier would keep roughly 1, 000 jobs in the state rather than moving them to mexico, thanks to $7 million in tax incentives negotiated by vice   mike pence, the current governor of indiana. this is the sort of package republicans have traditionally loathed. the once intensely conservative mr. pence channeled the views of mr. sanders when he explained the carrier deal by saying, “the free market has been sorting it out, and america’s been losing. ” mr. ryan and many other fiscal conservatives appeared to agree. “everyone here knows what it means to lose jobs in their districts,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma. “if trump can keep a thousand families from going through such an ordeal, then good for him. and if it makes other companies think twice about the human consequences of their business decisions, so much the better. ” but big tariffs appear too much to abide. both mr. ryan and senator mitch mcconnell, republican of kentucky and the majority leader, supported a bill that gave mr. obama and his successor special “fast track” authority to negotiate trade agreements, and are proponents of reducing tariff barriers. “tax cuts and deregulation will make the american economy great again, but tariffs and trade wars will make it tank again,” david mcintosh, president of the conservative group club for growth, said in a statement, adding, “the majority leader is right to caution against protectionism and to urge a robust debate on free markets and trade. ” house leaders want to tackle the problem of companies’ moving operations overseas with a broad rewriting of the corporate tax code, which they say will make american manufacturing more competitive without resorting to punitive measures on individual companies. “tough talk plays well with his base and is arguably even long overdue,” said brian walsh, a republican consultant and former official at the national republican senatorial committee. “but ultimately, the legislative focus will be on tax reform and deregulation versus tariffs and trade wars. i don’t believe republicans will let a golden opportunity to finally pass comprehensive tax reform fall victim to intraparty squabbling. ” republicans also fought mightily this week to remove a provision from a water bill favored by democrats     and aligned with mr. trump’s campaign promises     that would require the use of   iron and steel for domestic water infrastructure projects. they said they feared the measure would direct federal funding to some domestic companies but not others. mr. trump has long been a proponent of propping up the american steel industry, even though he has used imported steel for some of his building projects. next on the horizon could be a medicare fight. mr. trump said during his campaign that threats to change the program caused his party to lose its bid for the white house in 2012,   mr. ryan in his swipe. mr. trump and mr. ryan are in   mode at present, but how much that holds up remains to be seen. mr. ryan has a proposal to transform the medicaid program into a block grant and change the medicare program so that americans now under 55 would get a specified amount of money from the federal government toward the premium for private health coverage. mr. trump has been inconsistent on the medicare issue, and his choice for secretary of health and human services, representative tom price, shares mr. ryan’s views., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     the most powerful and ambitious   congress in 20 years will convene tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of american life     refashioning the country’s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the obama administration. even before   donald j. trump is sworn in on jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities     most notably a measure to clear a path for the affordable care act’s repeal. perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new congress is the push for deregulation. also up early: filling a   supreme court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for mr. trump’s cabinet nominees. “it’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,” said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader. “and we intend to do it. ” but as republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of congress for their more partisan goals, democrats are preparing roadblocks. the party’s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of russian election interference, mr. trump’s   cabinet picks and his taunting twitter posts. (on saturday, he offered new year’s wishes “to all,” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. ”) obstacles will also come from republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. and any burst of legislative action will come only if congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. for republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved     the house in particular has signaled the republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. but many of those measures have gathered dust in the senate or been doused in veto ink. the cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent house republican majority in the  . speaker newt gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the senate majority leader, bob dole, who stacked conservative house bills like so many fire logs in the back of the senate chamber. “they’ve been given a golden opportunity here,” said trent lott, the former republican senate majority leader. “but i have watched over the years when one party has had control of the white house and the senate and the house, and the danger is overplaying your hand. “if you go too far, like what happened with obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,” mr. lott continued. “you have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ” the tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the senate finance committee is already moving in that direction. still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from mr. trump’s chief of staff, reince priebus. the senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for mr. trump. republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. but on many issues, senate democrats     including their new leader, chuck schumer of new york     are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of mr. trump’s agenda. “after campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   trump’s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he’s sworn in,” said senator patty murray, democrat of washington. “democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ” republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that president obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the trump team on which ones should be undone. “i hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,” the house speaker, paul d. ryan of wisconsin, said at a recent forum. “i think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ” in late december, the obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. that regulation, one of dozens that mr. trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. but congress is likely to block it, using the obscure congressional review act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion. given time constraints on the senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. they are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. republicans will also move quickly to repeal the affordable care act. they plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year     already a quarter over     that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any democratic filibuster. but republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace mr. obama’s, and they may delay the repeal measure’s effective date for years. the senate must also consider mr. trump’s cabinet picks, and senate democrats are already trying to slow the process. however, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than supreme court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with mr. trump’s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. republicans have been particularly upset that senator jeff sessions of alabama, whom mr. trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with democrats on the senate judiciary committee or had meetings canceled. senator dianne feinstein of california postponed her meeting with mr. sessions until january because, she said, her schedule got too busy. “the senator doesn’t want to rush,” said her spokesman, tom mentzer. one reason that democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over mr. mcconnell’s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the supreme court nomination of judge merrick b. garland. lingering in the background is the specter of russia. democrats     and some republicans, who are at odds with mr. trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him     want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. the obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. while republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. “this is no time for hubris,” mr. mcconnell said. “you have to perform. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(in one letter, donald j. trump ranted about the crisis of unsightly hot dog vendors on his beloved fifth avenue. “having ketchup and mustard splattered all over the sidewalk,” he wrote, “is disgraceful. ” in another note, he paid flowery tribute to his young wife, whom he referred to as “my little darling. ” “you’re everything i hoped for,” he wrote. in a different missive, he offered a rare admission of weakness, declaring, “i am nothing more than a frustrated writer of little talent. ” mr. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, is a master of modern media, exploiting twitter and television to punish his enemies, energize his allies and promote himself. but perhaps his most powerful and memorable form of communication is the   ritual of a personal letter, written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping, signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of trump tower. churned out prolifically from a   desk, they are letters of gratitude, hate, flattery and revenge, dispatched to teenage admirers and   mayors, professional athletes and magazine editors. the tone can range from florid to juvenile, pleading to poisonous. tightly clutched and prominently displayed even by those who despise him, the epistles have become keepsakes and mementos for hundreds of people across the country. viewed as a collection from the 1970s to now, they offer an unusual archive of his emotional ups and downs. the 2009 letter that mr. trump sent to mike tollin, a movie director, makes for painful reading: it denounced a film by mr. tollin that explored mr. trump’s role in the collapse of a football league as “third rate” and “extremely dishonest. ” in a fulminating flourish, mr. trump wrote: “p. s. you are a loser. ” nevertheless, mr. tollin had the letter framed and he keeps it on a shelf in his office, next to photographs of his family. “people come by and immediately want to see it, touch it and hold it,” mr. tollin said with pride. today, as mr. trump tries to make peace with hostile figures in his party, the candidate renowned for his rhetorical flame throwing is deploying a conciliatory style of letter writing as his chief weapon. his handwritten overtures have started to arrive in the mailboxes of seemingly implacable foes, like charlie sykes, a conservative radio host in milwaukee, who has described mr. trump as a “whiny,   bully. ” “charlie,” began mr. trump’s note, scribbled with a thick black pen on the front page of the new york times, next to an article about skeptical republicans warming to mr. trump, “i hope you can change your mind. ” ever attuned to incentives, the real estate mogul dangled an offer: “look forward to doing your show,” he wrote, adding, “i will win!” it did not change mr. sykes’s dim view of mr. trump. but he was, he conceded, impressed by the gesture. “give him credit that he’s doing this,” mr. sykes said. “he’s willing to do some things that might be somewhat at odds with his public image. ” the letters     culled from personal and public archives     reveal mr. trump’s insecurities, but also his perceptiveness about power, ego and what motivates people. from early on, he seemed to intuitively grasp the potency of his praise when lavished on   men. in the 1990s, mr. trump occasionally fawned over new york’s brash mayor, rudolph w. giuliani. in one letter, mr. trump tore out a page from a magazine interview in which he had called mr. giuliani “the greatest mayor that the city’s ever had. ” in case mr. giuliani missed the homage, mr. trump drew two bold arrows, each pointing at the glowing passage, and reiterated the message in a handwritten note: “rudy, you are the greatest!” he wrote, adding, “see you soon. ” there is never any question about authorship: mr. trump’s style of writing sounds virtually identical to his hyperbolic manner of speech, with a healthy sprinkling of the words “great” and “tremendous,” abundant displays of   and    claims of success or doom. in a 1985 letter to mayor edward i. koch, mr. trump predicted new york city’s imminent downfall if a fellow real estate developer, arthur e. imperatore sr. were allowed to start a ferry service between new jersey and manhattan. “real estate values and taxes in new york would plummet,” mr. trump prognosticated darkly. “why would anyone want to live or shop in new york?” (mr. imperatore started the ferry service without destroying new york’s economy.) as a writer, mr. trump sometimes reached, awkwardly but earnestly, for eloquence. in a 1983 letter to a. m. rosenthal, then the executive editor of the times and a lunch companion, mr. trump turned poetic as he tried to capture his reaction to an article that mr. rosenthal had written about returning to  poland for the first time in decades. “it is moving it is sad it is hopeful (?) it is devastating,” mr. trump wrote, saying that his wife at the time, ivana, who grew up in eastern europe, agreed. “it truly captured the strength, the will and the soul of the polish people,” mr. trump wrote. he could write with striking tenderness to ivana, according to notes reviewed by the times. “i adore and love my little darling,” he wrote to her in one. “i truly believe that you are the greatest,” he wrote in another. on the page, anyway, mr. trump was even capable of humility, describing himself as a scribe of “little talent” in a 1985 note to arthur ochs sulzberger, then the publisher of the times. (mr. trump had an agenda: to complain about a reporter he disliked.) mr. trump traces his epistolary habits to his attempt to win over franklin m. jarman, who controlled a manhattan department store that mr. trump wanted to buy in the 1970s to make way for trump tower. mr. jarman rarely replied to mr. trump’s letters, but he had, in fact, read them, mr. trump wrote in his book “the art of the deal,” laying the groundwork for an agreement. “the letters i wrote eventually did have an impact,” mr. trump said. for years, mr. trump sent his letters the   way, by mail. but over time, members of his staff dragged him into the internet era     sort of. he still writes by hand, brandishing the favored tool of teachers’ corrections and athletes’ autographs, a black sharpie. now his aides often turn the letters into digital files, scanning them and sending them by email. but he refuses to let anyone else do the writing. “if i had a secretary to do them,” he said in an interview, “they wouldn’t be nearly as effective, they wouldn’t be nearly as sharp. ” each letter concludes with his extravagant signature, which resembles a city skyline or “a seismograph,” as graydon carter, the editor of vanity fair and a repeat recipient of mr. trump’s screeds, described it. many of his letters targeted the famous and credentialed, but from time to time they reached the little known and uninfluential. mr. trump penned a letter of encouragement in 2014 to an    student in texas, john russell niederer, who had expressed a desire to meet him. “work hard and be smart,” mr. trump told him. the letter now hangs on mr. niederer’s bedroom wall. “for him to take the time to send a message to somebody like me,” he said, “was really, really cool. ” a vindictive side is never far from view in mr. trump’s correspondence. after the basketball legend kareem   wrote a critical essay in the washington post about mr. trump’s candidacy, mr. trump sent him a copy of the essay with a biting message sprawled across it. “now i know why the press always treated you so badly     they couldn’t stand you,” mr. trump wrote. “the fact is that you don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make america great again!” mr.   said he was flabbergasted. “it was such a petty and childish reaction, like a teenage boy responding to being turned down for a date by whining, ‘well, nobody likes you!’ ” he said. he likened mr. trump’s decision to write his reply on the original article to “a dog urinating on a tree to mark its territory. ” mr.   had to get rid of the letter. “i crumpled it up real nice and tight and skyhooked it into my wastepaper basket,” he recalled, invoking his trademark shot. others cannot let go. “i’m definitely going to keep it,” mr. sykes, the radio host, said of his letter. “probably in a desk drawer. ”, Michael Barbaro, 6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.458877\n",
      "(washington     paul d. ryan, the reluctant house speaker, eager 2012   nominee and youthful answer to hillary clinton, should be sprinting toward the republican convention, a bright, optimistic star poised to sell his party’s agenda. instead, mr. ryan finds himself essentially slouching toward cleveland, hampered in the house by restive republicans and emboldened democrats, and his spotlight taken by a nominee who has yet to fully earn his respect. mr. ryan’s fledgling speakership, which he once suggested would be one giant policy discussion, has instead been a series of extraordinary challenges. he has sought to be the voice of moral clarity for his party, even as republicans fracture over the divisive candidacy of donald j. trump. he has tried to ground himself in republican policy as the country’s political axis has shifted after terrorist attacks and gun violence, and has taken to more populist economic views. mr. ryan, the country’s   republican, seeks to maintain his stature in the party without alienating its trumpian factions or its   traditionalists. his most basic legislative agenda     getting a budget and spending bills passed     has failed, killed off by his right flank. he has been through a month of altercations with democrats over gun legislation, and now is forced to punish them for their   on the house floor. what would seem to be among his easier tasks     backing the presumptive republican presidential nominee     has become a bizarre ritual of alternately denouncing and then supporting mr. trump, on an almost weekly basis. an attempt to pass a modest bill aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring guns has been deeply resisted by many republicans, even though their senate counterparts want it. instead of sitting around poring over policy with committee chairmen, mr. ryan, 46, spends much of his day dealing with minor member issues, like complaints that he did not return messages quickly enough. mr. ryan grudgingly agreed to his speakership     for which he was drafted under protest     to give his party a sense of unity and stability. he now finds himself in the most chaotic climate his party has seen in more than a generation. “paul ryan has stepped into an enormously complicated situation,” said representative charlie dent of pennsylvania, who is one of the moderate house republicans who have distanced themselves from mr. trump. “the underlying dynamics that drove out john boehner remain,” mr. dent said of the former speaker. “now you have donald trump and all his rhetoric, and he knows most of his members want him to support trump while others like me want to keep their distance. then, not being able to pass a budget may be one of the greatest frustrations for the speaker. a lot of members don’t want anything to do with firearms or the budget. they want to cancel the session after the election. that is where we are. ” unlike mr. boehner, who went sailing into private life after being deposed by conservatives, mr. ryan continues to cheerfully promote the house agenda. he makes frequent television appearances and attends local media events at home in wisconsin. he will tell anyone who will listen about the conservative policy agenda he intends to pursue next year, in spite of the possibility that mrs. clinton might be in the white house. further, mr. trump has shown little interest in his priorities so far. “when the speaker took the job, he did it to help steady the ship at a difficult moment,” said brendan buck, a spokesman for mr. ryan. “he continues to try to be a stabilizing figure for the party and this place. ” also, unlike mr. boehner, mr. ryan remains largely popular with his fellow house republicans, who have appreciated his inclusive style. even among supporters of mr. trump, there is respect for mr. ryan’s consistency on core party issues. it is particularly rankling for mr. ryan, a former chairman of the house budget committee, that he is unable to pass a budget. the most conservative house republicans do not want to honor a deal struck by mr. boehner and the white house last year, which raised statutory budget caps to increase government spending. many have made it clear they will not vote for a budget with that higher spending level. this has made the appropriations process equally charged. but that is where mr. ryan has other problems. those bills have failed because of fights over  an amendment to bar federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, fights over the use of the confederate flag and other social issues. with republicans likely to lose seats in november, narrowing their large majority in the house, the most conservative members are likely to make up a larger, not small percentage of his conference after november. gerrymandered republican house districts, which produce very conservative members, and the probable sweeping out of moderate members in a presidential year combine to make it so. democrats, smelling blood but not well positioned to take back the house, have instead challenged mr. ryan. two weeks ago, a rattled mr. ryan looked out on the house floor, where he has spent much of his adult life, and saw hundreds of democrats, including many with whom he has served for years, shouting him down over gun control legislation. at 3 a. m. the heckles seemed to engulf the normally affable speaker as he struggled to call a vote on yet another bill that would go nowhere     this one helping to fight the zika virus. two weeks later, and the day after the death of five police officers in dallas, mr. ryan stared out at those same colleagues and begged for conciliation in a moving speech on the floor. “there will be a temptation to let our anger harden our divisions,” mr. ryan said friday. “let’s not let that happen. let’s defy those predictions. ” democrats, who had planned another set of protests that day, stood down. still, mr. ryan has vowed some form of punishment for their  . what happened on the house floor over the past few weeks “illustrated just how he is caught in the currents within his own party,” said representative sander m. levin, democrat of michigan, who served with mr. ryan on the ways and means committee and is close to him. “i was surprised by his comments that our gun protests were a political stunt when

      "(tucson, ariz.     senator john mccain does not say much these days about donald j. trump’s attack on his   years as a prisoner of war. instead, he clenches his teeth and says he will support the republican party’s presumptive nominee, who once said derisively about the senator’s time in captivity, “i like people that weren’t captured. ” in the   swelter here in arizona, his home state, mr. mccain, who was the republicans’ presidential nominee and   in 2008, did not openly bemoan this moment from his long political life. he is focusing on what he considers his toughest   fight yet, and is betting that the only way to keep his seat is to support mr. trump. “i’m fair game. i’m in the arena,” said mr. mccain, 79, whose thinning face reflects the decades he has spent traveling around his massive and increasingly diverse state. still, the episode sits with traces of bitterness, like old coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup, even if he says otherwise. for a moment, the july attack on mr. mccain seemed to be mr. trump’s undoing. mccain said he recalled a recent chat with a world war ii veteran who had been in a german prison camp. as he delivered the man a missing medal, “he said to me, ‘why would trump say something like that about us?’ ” the senator said. “frankly, i didn’t have an answer for it. ” but mr. trump has since called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a wall at the mexican border, and now the billionaire businessman could be the force that ultimately topples the indomitable mr. mccain. an estimated 433, 000 hispanics are expected to vote in arizona this november, an 8 percent increase from 2012. and mr. mccain has a credible democratic challenger, representative ann kirkpatrick, who grew up on an indian reservation and has strong support from the state’s sizable native american population. “i just came from a latino round table, and they are really concerned about mccain’s support for trump,” she said tuesday. “it’s very personal here. ” she is working with the state’s democrats to harness these forces against mr. mccain and his old guard, which is largely behind mr. trump. ms. kirkpatrick said that being   “is a strong message,” but she acknowledged that “it’s not the only message. ” she recently opened a field office in tempe, and has many arizona state university volunteers working the phones. working out of an old bank, aides sit in the former vault (the door has been removed) to go over mr. mccain’s statements, year by year, and look for inconsistencies that suggest too long a stay in congress. “the race comes down to whether arizonans take a step back and judge john mccain for being john mccain and his remarkable life of public service,” said grant woods, a former state attorney general and the senator’s friend for decades. “and not as being a   incumbent, and not as a republican in a year when the party has a controversial nominee. if they do that, he will win walking away. if they don’t, then it could be tight. could he lose? yeah. ” despite the personal attacks by mr. trump on the senator’s integrity and war record, mr. mccain cannot afford to reject mr. trump and alienate his many supporters in arizona if he hopes to hold his seat, an agonizing  . mr. mccain is the embodiment of much that voters in both parties, but especially fans of mr. trump, have said they would like to jettison this year. he is the ultimate establishment player, having served in congress for nearly four decades     five terms in the senate alone. “back in the middle ages, i was known as the maverick,” mr. mccain said, smiling wanly. he is an unapologetic free trader, an interventionist abroad who continues to defend the deeply unpopular war in iraq, a supporter of private industry and markets, and the original, if inconstant, champion of changes to the immigration system that would help some illegal immigrants become citizens. to succeed in what most people believe will be his last political campaign, mr. mccain must canter around the state assuring mr. trump’s detractors that he does not share the businessman’s visions for mass deportation and the dissolution of nato, while continuing to woo an angry republican base that overwhelmingly voted for mr. trump in the state’s march primary. “i’ve been feeling it out there for some time,” mr. mccain said. “in the southern part of the state here, they are not feeling the recovery at all. then there is this whole issue with these young people and kids carrying around all this debt. ” “that’s the bernie effect,” he said, referring to senator bernie sanders’s youth appeal in the democratic primaries. he added: “the turmoil in this race is more than i’ve ever seen. younger, newer voters are registering for only one reason, to vote against trump. so my challenge is to convince that younger, newer voter that i am for them. ” his greater challenge may be with latinos angry at mr. trump. according to an analysis of voter and census data by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials educational fund, latinos are expected to account for 17 percent of arizona’s registered electorate this year, with a voter turnout rate at close to 70 percent. nearly 45 percent of latino registered voters are democrats, the report found. “i’ve always spent a lot of time with the hispanic community,” mr. mccain said, “but having said that, they are rising in numbers in the voting population. i’m putting more emphasis there, particularly in light of trump’s comments. ” hispanics in the phoenix area will also be heavily motivated to vote in the sheriff’s election joe arpaio, a trump supporter who was recently found in contempt of court for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining latinos, will be on the ballot, trying to keep his seat as maricopa county sheriff. a day watching mr. mccain campaign here this past week reflects his evolving challenges. he sat for the endorsement of a small group of border patrol agents, who have also endorsed mr. trump, and listened in silence as art del cueto, the president of tucson local 2455 of the national border patrol council, explained why mr. trump had gotten their approval. “it means so much to me this long relationship we’ve had,” mr. mccain said about his endorsement, “and the support we’ve tried to provide. ” mr. del cueto did say that “we did talk to donald” about his comments concerning mr. mccain’s war record. “i don’t think it was a comment that has been made again,” he said. but a bit later, meeting with hispanic business leaders, mr. mccain opened with “we’re going to make america great again and it’s going to be huge, o. k.?” it was a tiny swipe at mr. trump, taken in the manner of a toddler grabbing a cookie when he assumes no one is looking. then it was on to other topics, like the federal aviation administration reauthorization. mr. mccain remains most at home with other veterans, like the one he visited     on memorial day, another man waiting on medals. “his wife said he was staying alive to get those medals,” mr. mccain said, smiling at the memory. “sometimes it’s a nice job. ”,

      "(when tony schwartz was writing donald j. trump’s first book, “the art of the deal,” in the late 1980s, he was startled by his client’s short attention span. during their first interview, mr. trump endured just a few minutes of mr. schwartz’s questions before leaping up from his chair and declaring the entire exercise a waste of his time. “he couldn’t tolerate doing interviews,” he tells me. “he just couldn’t stay focused for more than a few minutes at a time. and think about this, michael, it was when he was talking about himself, which is his favorite subject. ” in the latest episode of the   mr. schwartz explains why he is sharing his intimate knowledge of how mr. trump thinks and behaves with aides to hillary clinton to help her prepare for monday night’s highly anticipated presidential debate. he’s worried about a habit he noticed during ms. clinton’s performance at a national security forum hosted by nbc news a week ago: “what i would hope is that she doesn’t go the same route she did with matt lauer when he started coming at her relentlessly, which was to revert to her knowledge, to revert to her ability to produce a hundred facts in a short period of time,” he says. “because this debate is going to turn not a bit on the issues. it’s going to turn on emotion, it’s going to turn on which candidate makes all of us feel safer and which candidate makes us feel less safe. and the one who wins that contest wins the debate     and probably wins the election. ” mr. schwartz offered his help to the clinton campaign as part of his long (and possibly futile) effort to make up for the guilt he feels about setting mr. trump on a path to fame by ghostwriting his book. “i don’t think i can ever even the score i don’t think i can ever set it totally straight,” he says. all he can do now, he says, is “say the truth that i know in the service of trying to help save the country and the world from a guy who is exceptionally dangerous. ” in the episode, we explore the profoundly contrasting style of preparation and showmanship that mr. trump and mrs. clinton bring to the debate with my colleagues, frank bruni, an opinion columnist, and amy chozick, a reporter who has covered mrs. clinton for the last two years. “i think of trump as a toddler sitting in a high chair,” mr. bruni says. “and his advisers are saying ‘donald, you must get through the meal without throwing your spaghetti on the wall.’ so the question is, will they successfully persuade him not to throw his spaghetti on the wall before the debate ends?” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(as with so many elements of this presidential campaign, the way in which hillary clinton and donald j. trump have handled their medical histories feels strange, secretive and theatrical (dr. oz, anyone? ). but there’s a long and rich history of candidates concealing     even lying about     the details of their health. in the latest episode of the   we talk to john dickerson, a history buff, columnist at slate and moderator of cbs’s “face the nation,” who recalls the united states’ pivotal brush with a president’s   ailment: the heart attack of dwight d. eisenhower in 1955. mr. dickerson, the author of “whistlestop,” a new book about the history of presidential campaigns, explains how the white house’s initial resistance to disclose the incident triggered something new in american public life: a deluge of deeply private medical information about the commander in chief. we also speak with the doctor who, more than anyone else, is responsible for our modern expectation that candidates give detailed disclosures about their health: lawrence k. altman, a reporter at the new york times who was the first to interview candidates about their medical histories. mr. altman recalls his tough and sadly prescient question to ronald reagan when he was a candidate in 1980 about a potential condition that would later haunt him. we also hear from voters in times square about whether they even care about candidates’ health. short answer: not particularly. one voter told us he’d be going with mrs. clinton over mr. trump. was there anything about her health that might change that? “i’m pretty sure he’s crazy,” the man said, “and that’s more dangerous than her dying in office. ” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(when tony schwartz was writing donald j. trump’s first book, “the art of the deal,” in the late 1980s, he was startled by his client’s short attention span. during their first interview, mr. trump endured just a few minutes of mr. schwartz’s questions before leaping up from his chair and declaring the entire exercise a waste of his time. “he couldn’t tolerate doing interviews,” he tells me. “he just couldn’t stay focused for more than a few minutes at a time. and think about this, michael, it was when he was talking about himself, which is his favorite subject. ” in the latest episode of the   mr. schwartz explains why he is sharing his intimate knowledge of how mr. trump thinks and behaves with aides to hillary clinton to help her prepare for monday night’s highly anticipated presidential debate. he’s worried about a habit he noticed during ms. clinton’s performance at a national security forum hosted by nbc news a week ago: “what i would hope is that she doesn’t go the same route she did with matt lauer when he started coming at her relentlessly, which was to revert to her knowledge, to revert to her ability to produce a hundred facts in a short period of time,” he says. “because this debate is going to turn not a bit on the issues. it’s going to turn on emotion, it’s going to turn on which candidate makes all of us feel safer and which candidate makes us feel less safe. and the one who wins that contest wins the debate     and probably wins the election. ” mr. schwartz offered his help to the clinton campaign as part of his long (and possibly futile) effort to make up for the guilt he feels about setting mr. trump on a path to fame by ghostwriting his book. “i don’t think i can ever even the score i don’t think i can ever set it totally straight,” he says. all he can do now, he says, is “say the truth that i know in the service of trying to help save the country and the world from a guy who is exceptionally dangerous. ” in the episode, we explore the profoundly contrasting style of preparation and showmanship that mr. trump and mrs. clinton bring to the debate with my colleagues, frank bruni, an opinion columnist, and amy chozick, a reporter who has covered mrs. clinton for the last two years. “i think of trump as a toddler sitting in a high chair,” mr. bruni says. “and his advisers are saying ‘donald, you must get through the meal without throwing your spaghetti on the wall.’ so the question is, will they successfully persuade him not to throw his spaghetti on the wall before the debate ends?” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(there’s a forgotten scene in the third season of “the sopranos” when the wives of the show’s mob crew, sitting inside a local italian restaurant, turn to the delicate subject of hillary clinton, monica lewinsky, infidelity and marriage. it’s 2001 and mrs. clinton is headed to the senate. the women assembled around the table, all of whom know their husbands are unfaithful, are simultaneously disgusted by mrs. clinton and in awe of her. “i can’t stand that woman,” says angie bonpensiero. “i don’t know,” says rosalie aprile. “maybe we could all take a page from her book. ” it’s left to the boss’s wife, carmela soprano to sort through her own messy emotions. she veers from instinctive revulsion (“to be humiliated in public then walk around smiling all the time”) to grudging admiration for how a woman not unlike herself, overshadowed by a cheating spouse, has emerged as powerful, independent figure in her own right. “she’s a role model for all of us,” mrs. soprano says on second thought, as the wives nod in agreement. in the latest episode of the   we examine a potent electoral force we rarely talk about when we talk about the campaign: pop culture. both mrs. clinton and donald j. trump are   stars in their own right, who have spawned     and inspired     television characters and shows from “the apprentice” (mr. trump) to the “the good wife” (mrs. clinton). we talk to the chief television critic at the new york times, james poniewozik, about how television and film characters past and present inform our views of both candidates     or have been created in the candidates’ images. “they are both characters in pop culture, characters in mass media, whose stories we have literally been hearing for decades,” mr. poniewozik says of the candidates. “usually in an election, there’s some narrative of some new character you haven’t encountered before: barack obama in 2008, george w. bush in 2000. here, it’s two   american television serials having a crossover episode. ” so if this   campaign is a crossover television event, how would mr. poniewozik, as a tv critic, review the show? “i think the writers have really taken it over the top. it’s like watching ‘scandal’ in its eighth season where you just feel that they have exhausted every possible trick and they’re emptying their notebooks at you. ” would you commit to another season? “i think i’d like to see it recast. ” and we chat with susan dominus, of the times magazine, about the surprising ways that gender is playing out in pop cultural depictions of mr. trump and mrs. clinton in this campaign, a topic she is studying closely this year. “if we are going to extend gender stereotypes all the way to their worst place, it’s celebrity, lightweight     that reads as in some ways feminine and inconsequential or not perceived as a real threat,” ms. dominus says. and in that sense, mr. trump, in some ways, is the more feminized figure. “for all of his bluster, when was the last time that people were this obsessed with a candidate’s hair?” ms. dominus asks. “it was hillary in 2008!” from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(did hillary clinton, or somebody very much like her, have to be the first woman to get this close to winning the presidency? we explore that question in the latest episode of the   with claire mccaskill, the senior united states senator from missouri, and gail collins, a new york times columnist who has written several books on women’s history. what   combination of factors is required for a country to embrace a woman as its leader for the first time? longtime public exposure? proximity to power? moderate politics? and how powerful, perhaps even necessary, is it that this first woman be the spouse of a former president? history offers a guide: the first female president of any country was isabel martínez de perón of argentina, the wife of its former president. the first woman elected to the united states senate, hattie wyatt caraway, was the widow of a senator. and now the united states has the first woman candidate in the general election. “given our history it’s not surprising it’s the wife of somebody who had the job first,” ms. collins said. “some day we’ll have some really charismatic woman who gets people all excited, and it doesn’t matter that she’s only been in the senate for two years and that we don’t know much about her except her story,” ms. collins said. mrs. clinton’s presidential runs will have paved the way for that woman to have a shot. “no matter what happens in this election, one of the great contributions hillary clinton has made to american history is that she made it seem sort of normal to have a woman running for president in 2008,” ms. collins said. “before then it had never been a normal thing. ” america is behind many other countries on that front, as senator mccaskill pointed out. “many of us are painfully aware of how many countries around the world have elected and admired women executives in their government, and it is embarrassing to many of us that america has not taken that step,” she said. “the irony is that everyone always would pat women on the head and say ‘well you know as soon as a woman is qualified there will be a woman president,’ ” senator mccaskill said. “now we have a stark differential in qualifications, and now it seems to be all about her integrity and how likable she is. ” in the episode, we discuss the challenges of running against a woman with former representative rick lazio of long island, a man who discovered those pitfalls in a very public fashion. in 2000, he was mrs. clinton’s opponent in the race for the united states senate seat in new york. in a   debate moment, mr. lazio approached mrs. clinton’s podium to ask her to sign a pledge, a tactic many saw as an overly aggressive male gesture toward a female rival. mr. lazio told us it was a mistake that he still regrets     and one whose visual impact he underestimated in the moment. “our folks all thought we had won the debate hands down,” he told us. but the next day, he saw that clip played over and over again and realized that the moment was going to stick. “the mistake that i made     and it was a mistake     was to create an optic where it looked like i was somebody other than who i was it looked like i was invading her space and was not chivalrous,” he told us. “it was spun in the media and shown over and over again, and it looked like it was an overbearing male approaching a female. ” please let us know what you think of the  . you can reach us at therunup@nytimes. com, or find me on twitter. you can also rate and review us on itunes. from a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above. or if you’re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series. on your iphone or ipad: 1. open your podcast app. it’s a   app called “podcasts” with a purple icon.

      "(on the eve of our debut episode of “the daily,” president trump delivered a major news story. for his first supreme court nomination, he selected neil m. gorsuch, a conservative judge with a sterling résumé. i spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful new york times colleagues about what it means. maggie haberman, a white house reporter, explains mr. trump’s reverence for the supreme court. carl hulse, the dean of congressional reporters, explains what to expect during the confirmation process. and adam liptak, our chief legal correspondent, introduces the country’s new supreme court nominee. to understand more about judge gorsuch, i also talk to david green, the chief executive of hobby lobby, a company at the center of one of judge gorsuch’s most important cases. he ruled that corporations with religious owners     like hobby lobby     cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. “we voted for trump, not that we agree with everything he does,” mr. green tells me on the show, speaking for himself and his wife. “the most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the constitution,” he said, referring to the supreme court. “because if you rule on the constitution, it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something, and that we would have our religious liberties. ” tune in, and tell us what you think. email us at thedaily@nytimes. com. tweet me at @mikiebarb. and if that isn’t enough, we can even text. if you are on your phone and don’t see an audio player on this page, follow the instructions below. on your iphone or ipad: open the preloaded app called “podcasts” it has a purple icon. if you’re reading this from your phone, tap this link, which will take you straight there.

      "(washington     he didn’t see it coming. speaker paul d. ryan was in a hotel room in cincinnati last may when he learned that donald j. trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the republican nomination for president. mr. trump had recently lost the wisconsin primary, which mr. ryan and other republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. senator ted cruz of texas had made strides, and mr. ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. but he badly miscalculated. the ensuing path, from mr. trump’s securing the nomination to mr. ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in wisconsin a month before election day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that mr. trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. mr. ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of reince priebus, chairman of the republican national committee and a fellow wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to mr. trump. now, mr. ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve republican control of congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. if mr. trump is defeated on nov. 8     as mr. ryan has all but conceded     but republicans maintain their house majority, it will fall largely to mr. ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. there is, of course, the question of whether house members would let him do so. the republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the house decision on whether the speaker should be mr. ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies trumpism. democrats have moved quickly to paint mr. ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of mr. trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying mr. ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. on saturday, mr. ryan’s office added to that criticism of mr. trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for mr. ryan. for his part, mr. trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of mr. ryan. last week, in a series of twitter posts, he called mr. ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee. ” for now, the speaker spends his days treating mr. trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of hillary clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered house republicans. “right now his objective is crystal clear,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma, “to retain the republican majority in the house. in that effort he has helped members of the freedom caucus as well as those in the tuesday group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “we will worry about our internal differences after the election. right now we are in a bar fight and every republican is worth saving. ” that mr. ryan and mr. trump were never natural allies is understandable. they had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the white house, an encounter at a   in new york during the 2012 campaign. mr. ryan was mitt romney’s running mate. their paths would not cross again. “trump really wasn’t on paul’s radar screen,” said a. mark neuman, a ryan friend for two decades. “before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that mr. trump did not share mr. ryan’s passions for the green bay packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and midwest life with children. the relationship showed strains from the start, with mr. ryan alarmed by mr. trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. the speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to mr. trump for other republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “if we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. he made calls to several of the republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda mr. trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (the trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. mr. ryan also declined to be interviewed.) mr. ryan had hoped that mr. trump would eventually embrace his plan. when mr. trump clinched the nomination in may, mr. ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “the conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘don’t worry, this will end,’” said charlie sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in milwaukee and a friend of mr. ryan’s. “so it was a huge shock. i think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” with campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, mr. ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse mr. trump. none of this pleased mr. priebus, who prided himself on building the modern republican party in wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against mrs. clinton. in text messages and phone calls, mr. priebus tried to persuade mr. ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept mr. trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. mr. trump would yell at mr. priebus and in turn mr. priebus would needle mr. ryan. when that did not work, mr. trump claimed mr. ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to capitol hill to try to woo fellow republicans, a claim mr. ryan viewed as a serious breach. “that was the first realization that trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate mr. trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” in june, after a period of relative silence on mr. trump’s part, mr. ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. staff members of both men began to coordinate for the republican national convention. but days later mr. ryan aggressively criticized mr. trump for his remarks about a hispanic judge. another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “he was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” mr. sykes said. a bright spot came in july, when mr. trump chose indiana’s governor, mike pence, who has long been close to mr. ryan, as his running mate. privately, mr. pence tried to assure skeptical republicans that he would impose mr. ryan’s policy agenda if he and mr. trump captured the white house. then in august, mr. trump toyed with endorsing mr. ryan’s opponent in a primary. mr. ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. he watched mr. trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. mr. trump called mr. ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of mr. pence, and to seek debate advice, which mr. ryan said focused on preparation. (not heeded.) by the fall, mr. ryan had basically stopped speaking mr. trump’s name. the nominee made a request through the r. n. c. to campaign with mr. ryan, whose team agreed to invite mr. trump and mr. pence to an event this month in wisconsin. then came the tape of mr. trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. mr. sykes let mr. priebus know via text that mr. trump was no longer welcome in wisconsin. mr. sykes said mr. priebus responded: “i am the guy trying to fix this! i am in tears over this. ’” (a spokeswoman for mr. priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) mr. ryan agonized over his options. ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “i think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, who has renounced mr. trump. “his job is to help house republicans. period. ” mr. ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support mr. trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “we knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” mr. sykes said. “how much damage could they do?”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)    0.505448\n",
      "(washington     when donald j. trump goes low, congressional republicans go quiet. their tolerance of mr. trump, even at the risk of humiliation, stems from a complex brew of political, policy and personal calculations that differ somewhat between party leaders and officials up for  . but on one point, all sides agree: they have never seen a comparable situation, with a presidential nominee in open warfare with party leaders after a nominating convention. and mr. trump’s provocations are making the republicans’ control of the senate, perhaps even the house, more tenuous. many republicans, even those whose contempt for mr. trump matches their ill will for president obama, still view the choice between mr. trump and hillary clinton as a binary one, with   implications for every policy area they care about, from judicial appointments to the economy to immigration. they believe that mr. trump, guided by a   congress, will break their way more than mrs. clinton ever would. for others, the vacancy on the supreme court     and its potential to reshape the high court’s rulings for years     overshadow almost everything else, even their nominee’s increasingly erratic statements and grasp of basic facts. “the supreme court is probably the choice that will have the single most   effect on the nation,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, where mr. trump is struggling to win over an overwhelmingly republican state. congressional republicans who are up for       especially the handful like senators john mccain of arizona and kelly ayotte of new hampshire who still face primaries     have made a basic calculation. they have criticized mr. trump, but not withdrawn their endorsements. and party leaders have decided the more distance they put between themselves and mr. trump, the more likely they are to lose their congressional majorities. alienating mr. trump’s supporters would cost them just enough votes to lose their seats. their fears at this point appear justified. a poll conducted the last week of july by cbs news found that support for mr. trump among republican voters rose to 81 percent from 79 percent. so the leaders largely responded to mr. trump’s attacks with feigned indifference. “republican elected officials are in a tough spot,” said nathan l. gonzales, the editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report, a nonpartisan newsletter. “they are criticized for not listening to the grass roots and criticized for not denouncing the nominee chosen by the grass roots. some republicans are reluctant to attack donald trump because they’d risk alienating 35 to 40 percent of the party who supported him in the primaries. ” mr. trump pointedly declined on tuesday to endorse speaker paul d. ryan, the nation’s   elected republican, and verged on outright opposition to mr. mccain and ms. ayotte, just hours after mr. obama challenged republicans to denounce their nominee. both mr. obama and mr. trump have put republicans into an untenable position: criticizing their nominee could be seen as taking the advice of a president whom their core voters strongly dislike, potentially alienating the very people they need for       but sitting idly as mr. trump attacks them and makes inflammatory comments might alienate more moderate voters. “if you are repeatedly having to say, in very strong terms, that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?” mr. obama asked during a news conference on tuesday. mr. ryan’s spokesman tersely responded that the speaker had never sought mr. trump’s endorsement, and ms. ayotte more or less brushed off the matter, saying, “i call it like i see it,” in reference to her defense of a fallen army captain whose family mr. trump had derided. while many republicans are hoping for ticket splitters     those who might vote democrat for president but republican on the rest of the ticket     the parsing is all the more difficult. many experts are skeptical that the approach can work. “in 2008 and 2010, voters did not draw distinctions,” said fergus cullen, a former chairman of the new hampshire republican party. “it was not like passover, where the door was marked, ‘this one should be spared.’ no, the angel of death came in and said no ‘let’s kill them all.’ ” it is not just a question of individual desires to win       although that certainly drives many of the statements about mr. trump that come short of rescinding an endorsement. republicans believe they need to maintain the house and the senate, through a   blend of votes from their base and   split tickets, to pursue a policy agenda. “the speaker’s goal, one that you set collectively with members of your conference, is to promote ideas and enact policies that make a difference,” said kevin madden, a republican operative who once worked for former speaker john a. boehner. “the political reality, though, is that this goal can only be reached if members are not put at risk because the top of the national ticket underperforms. ” republican leaders also know that in an   election cycle, the core of the party would most likely be disposed to reject candidates who embody the washington establishment. this was the lesson senator ted cruz of texas learned when he was booed from the stage at the republican convention last month for declining to get behind mr. trump, and accounts for some of the heat that senator ben sasse of nebraska, a founder of the never trump movement, has taken from his party back home this year. then, there is the vehement opposition to mrs. clinton, especially how they view her role in the benghazi attacks, that has dominated the airwaves for years among republicans. “i happen to think that lying to the american people is a step way above and beyond some of the disappointing rhetoric of donald trump,” said mr. chaffetz, the chairman of the house oversight committee. he added: “nothing united republicans more than hillary clinton. ” some still may pull away. on tuesday, representative richard hanna, republican of new york, said he would endorse mrs. clinton for president, calling mr. trump “unfit to serve. ” but mr. hanna is not representative of the broader republican conference. “he came to congress as an outsider and never fit neatly into the typical boxes,” mr. gonzales said. “he would have had another serious primary challenge this year, if he had decided to seek  . but since he’s retiring, he apparently feels even more freedom to say what’s on his mind. ” but if mr. trump falls in the polls and republicans running for   start to realize they would do better separating from him and digging deeper for   voters, mr. hanna might not be alone., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(washington     paul d. ryan, the reluctant house speaker, eager 2012   nominee and youthful answer to hillary clinton, should be sprinting toward the republican convention, a bright, optimistic star poised to sell his party’s agenda. instead, mr. ryan finds himself essentially slouching toward cleveland, hampered in the house by restive republicans and emboldened democrats, and his spotlight taken by a nominee who has yet to fully earn his respect. mr. ryan’s fledgling speakership, which he once suggested would be one giant policy discussion, has instead been a series of extraordinary challenges. he has sought to be the voice of moral clarity for his party, even as republicans fracture over the divisive candidacy of donald j. trump. he has tried to ground himself in republican policy as the country’s political axis has shifted after terrorist attacks and gun violence, and has taken to more populist economic views. mr. ryan, the country’s   republican, seeks to maintain his stature in the party without alienating its trumpian factions or its   traditionalists. his most basic legislative agenda     getting a budget and spending bills passed     has failed, killed off by his right flank. he has been through a month of altercations with democrats over gun legislation, and now is forced to punish them for their   on the house floor. what would seem to be among his easier tasks     backing the presumptive republican presidential nominee     has become a bizarre ritual of alternately denouncing and then supporting mr. trump, on an almost weekly basis. an attempt to pass a modest bill aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring guns has been deeply resisted by many republicans, even though their senate counterparts want it. instead of sitting around poring over policy with committee chairmen, mr. ryan, 46, spends much of his day dealing with minor member issues, like complaints that he did not return messages quickly enough. mr. ryan grudgingly agreed to his speakership     for which he was drafted under protest     to give his party a sense of unity and stability. he now finds himself in the most chaotic climate his party has seen in more than a generation. “paul ryan has stepped into an enormously complicated situation,” said representative charlie dent of pennsylvania, who is one of the moderate house republicans who have distanced themselves from mr. trump. “the underlying dynamics that drove out john boehner remain,” mr. dent said of the former speaker. “now you have donald trump and all his rhetoric, and he knows most of his members want him to support trump while others like me want to keep their distance. then, not being able to pass a budget may be one of the greatest frustrations for the speaker. a lot of members don’t want anything to do with firearms or the budget. they want to cancel the session after the election. that is where we are. ” unlike mr. boehner, who went sailing into private life after being deposed by conservatives, mr. ryan continues to cheerfully promote the house agenda. he makes frequent television appearances and attends local media events at home in wisconsin. he will tell anyone who will listen about the conservative policy agenda he intends to pursue next year, in spite of the possibility that mrs. clinton might be in the white house. further, mr. trump has shown little interest in his priorities so far. “when the speaker took the job, he did it to help steady the ship at a difficult moment,” said brendan buck, a spokesman for mr. ryan. “he continues to try to be a stabilizing figure for the party and this place. ” also, unlike mr. boehner, mr. ryan remains largely popular with his fellow house republicans, who have appreciated his inclusive style. even among supporters of mr. trump, there is respect for mr. ryan’s consistency on core party issues. it is particularly rankling for mr. ryan, a former chairman of the house budget committee, that he is unable to pass a budget. the most conservative house republicans do not want to honor a deal struck by mr. boehner and the white house last year, which raised statutory budget caps to increase government spending. many have made it clear they will not vote for a budget with that higher spending level. this has made the appropriations process equally charged. but that is where mr. ryan has other problems. those bills have failed because of fights over  an amendment to bar federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, fights over the use of the confederate flag and other social issues. with republicans likely to lose seats in november, narrowing their large majority in the house, the most conservative members are likely to make up a larger, not small percentage of his conference after november. gerrymandered republican house districts, which produce very conservative members, and the probable sweeping out of moderate members in a presidential year combine to make it so. democrats, smelling blood but not well positioned to take back the house, have instead challenged mr. ryan. two weeks ago, a rattled mr. ryan looked out on the house floor, where he has spent much of his adult life, and saw hundreds of democrats, including many with whom he has served for years, shouting him down over gun control legislation. at 3 a. m. the heckles seemed to engulf the normally affable speaker as he struggled to call a vote on yet another bill that would go nowhere     this one helping to fight the zika virus. two weeks later, and the day after the death of five police officers in dallas, mr. ryan stared out at those same colleagues and begged for conciliation in a moving speech on the floor. “there will be a temptation to let our anger harden our divisions,” mr. ryan said friday. “let’s not let that happen. let’s defy those predictions. ” democrats, who had planned another set of protests that day, stood down. still, mr. ryan has vowed some form of punishment for their  . what happened on the house floor over the past few weeks “illustrated just how he is caught in the currents within his own party,” said representative sander m. levin, democrat of michigan, who served with mr. ryan on the ways and means committee and is close to him. “i was surprised by his comments that our gun protests were a political stunt when he knew better,” mr. levin said. “he knew people like john lewis and myself are not   people. his comment was contrary to the way he usually conducts himself. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(o’fallon, mo.     for much of the year, democrats viewed jason kander as a perfect senate candidate running in the wrong state. a charismatic former military intelligence officer and missouri’s current secretary of state, mr. kander, 35, faced an entrenched republican incumbent in a place where donald j. trump seemed destined to win. then mr. kander released a television ad last month in which he put an   assault rifle together blindfolded while reciting a script about gun rights, and started assailing his rival, senator roy d. blunt, on his lobbyist ties. suddenly, it was game on. mr. kander’s poll numbers soared. so did the panic among republicans trying to save mr. blunt, and possibly their senate majority. mr. kander’s ascent is the starkest demonstration of the volatile and at times confounding dynamics of the battle for control of the senate, with at least six races in a statistical dead heat just over two weeks before election day. surprisingly, democrats have improved their chances in places like missouri and north carolina, where they seemed to have no shot just six months ago, while they have all but given up in ohio and pulled their money out of florida, where prospects had seemed bright. republicans continue to cling to hope in new hampshire, nevada and pennsylvania, despite what looks like faltering support for mr. trump in those states. in several cases, individual state dynamics, candidate quality and a   spending spree have had as much to do with the shifting prospects as the top of the ticket. “with two weeks to go, control of the senate is up for grabs,” said nathan gonzales, editor of the rothenberg  gonzales political report. “if republicans can break even in the tossup states, they have a chance to maintain control. but if the landscape shifts just a couple of points against republican candidates, democrats will capture the majority. ” in perhaps the oddest quirk of a decidedly erratic year, mr. kander may be benefiting from mr. trump’s   message. mr. blunt, who has served in congress since 1997 and whose family is chockablock with lobbyists, is the archetypal boogeyman mr. trump has attacked in his assault on washington insiders. mr. kander often finds trump and clinton supporters at his campaign events     people who fight among themselves, he said, even as they share support for him. “there are people who will choose to vote for donald trump because they want to shake up that conversation,” mr. kander said in an interview in st. louis. “they are not going to go to that next line on the ballot and vote for somebody who they know is exactly who donald trump is talking about. ” until 2004, missouri was an even more reliable presidential bellwether state than ohio. but growing homogeneity outside its larger cities has made it more reliably republican on the presidential level. still, it remains a state where voters have a tendency to pick democrats for other statewide offices. “the misconception about missouri is that it is a red state,” said ken warren, a professor of political science at st. louis university. “they don’t like democrats at the top of the ticket because they are seen as from out of town. but most of our statewide offices are held by democrats. ” it is a reality that mr. blunt seems to be just starting to confront, much to his party’s chagrin. “it’s a competitive race, like missouri races usually are,” he said in an interview at the local republican headquarters here, where he nibbled on a   bagel grabbed off a buffet, the sort of campaign sustenance typical of the exhausting final weeks on the road. “i’m confident of where we are. but not overly confident. ” as of   mr. blunt led mr. kander 46 percent to 44 percent, a    drop since august. democrats need to gain five seats to retake control of the senate     four if hillary clinton wins the presidency, which would give tim kaine, her vice president, a tiebreaking vote. both parties now, surprisingly, view missouri as a crucial state in that battle. “i’m the 51st vote,” mr. blunt warned a small group of female republican voters here on thursday, casting himself as the critical piece of a majority. “if mrs. clinton gets elected, the last place to have an impact on the court is the senate,” he said, referring to the united states supreme court. (it actually takes 60 votes to bring a supreme court nomination to the senate floor.) in an extremely costly year for senate races over all, missouri has become the     state, with $15 million in ads pouring into its race. two weeks after mr. kander’s   gun ad in september, political action committees and other outside groups dropped more than $8 million into the state on the two candidates, quadruple what they had spent in the previous two weeks, according to filings with the federal election commission. mr. kander has benefited from being a sui generis blend: at once, he is a   democrat, a veteran, a   lawyer who wears the outsider label, and the opponent of an incumbent who is the embodiment of washington longevity. he has focused on trying to turn mr. blunt’s experience into a liability. he has also homed in on the senator’s tangled family ties. mr. blunt’s wife is a lobbyist, and his three adult children are registered lobbyists as well. mr. kander’s ads and those of outside groups have suggested, among other things, that mr. blunt took votes to enrich industries that his family represented. for his part, mr. blunt and those groups supporting him have tried to cast mr. kander, who was a state representative before becoming secretary of state in 2013, as a toady for mrs. clinton and president obama, who are both unpopular here. one ad shows his face morphing into theirs with the tagline: “fresh face. same old liberal thinking. ” “senator blunt genuinely sees everything through the lens of partisan politics,” mr. kander said. (actually, mr. blunt is widely viewed as a consummate   in congress.) mr. kander’s military service is a boost, too, in a state with many veterans. mr. blunt’s draft deferments have also come up during the campaign, and he recently brought in another republican senator, joni ernst, who has served in the military, to support him at a veterans’ event. “  goes a long way here,” professor warren said. “superpatriotism is a big thing in missouri. ” missouri’s contest is indicative of the circumstances in many senate races. while mr. trump is weak in pennsylvania, for instance, the incumbent, senator patrick j. toomey, has managed to keep the race close by dint of his own record and a democratic candidate who has been less exciting than her party anticipated. at the same time, in a battle over an open seat in nevada, mr. trump has been a drag on the republican candidate, united states representative joe heck, not because mr. heck supports mr. trump but because his support for the republican nominee has waned. “in most cases trump is responsible” for republican weaknesses, said jennifer duffy, senior editor for the cook political report, “but there are quirky things going on. ” it is the sort of year that produces voters like michael brown, a vietnam veteran and conservative republican who came to a small   discussion last week with mr. kander in cape girardeau. mr. brown will not vote for mr. trump, he said, but remains undecided about the senate race. “this year is the toughest vote i’ve ever cast,” he said., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.338944\n",
      "(in one letter, donald j. trump ranted about the crisis of unsightly hot dog vendors on his beloved fifth avenue. “having ketchup and mustard splattered all over the sidewalk,” he wrote, “is disgraceful. ” in another note, he paid flowery tribute to his young wife, whom he referred to as “my little darling. ” “you’re everything i hoped for,” he wrote. in a different missive, he offered a rare admission of weakness, declaring, “i am nothing more than a frustrated writer of little talent. ” mr. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, is a master of modern media, exploiting twitter and television to punish his enemies, energize his allies and promote himself. but perhaps his most powerful and memorable form of communication is the   ritual of a personal letter, written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping, signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of trump tower. churned out prolifically from a   desk, they are letters of gratitude, hate, flattery and revenge, dispatched to teenage admirers and   mayors, professional athletes and magazine editors. the tone can range from florid to juvenile, pleading to poisonous. tightly clutched and prominently displayed even by those who despise him, the epistles have become keepsakes and mementos for hundreds of people across the country. viewed as a collection from the 1970s to now, they offer an unusual archive of his emotional ups and downs. the 2009 letter that mr. trump sent to mike tollin, a movie director, makes for painful reading: it denounced a film by mr. tollin that explored mr. trump’s role in the collapse of a football league as “third rate” and “extremely dishonest. ” in a fulminating flourish, mr. trump wrote: “p. s. you are a loser. ” nevertheless, mr. tollin had the letter framed and he keeps it on a shelf in his office, next to photographs of his family. “people come by and immediately want to see it, touch it and hold it,” mr. tollin said with pride. today, as mr. trump tries to make peace with hostile figures in his party, the candidate renowned for his rhetorical flame throwing is deploying a conciliatory style of letter writing as his chief weapon. his handwritten overtures have started to arrive in the mailboxes of seemingly implacable foes, like charlie sykes, a conservative radio host in milwaukee, who has described mr. trump as a “whiny,   bully. ” “charlie,” began mr. trump’s note, scribbled with a thick black pen on the front page of the new york times, next to an article about skeptical republicans warming to mr. trump, “i hope you can change your mind. ” ever attuned to incentives, the real estate mogul dangled an offer: “look forward to doing your show,” he wrote, adding, “i will win!” it did not change mr. sykes’s dim view of mr. trump. but he was, he conceded, impressed by the gesture. “give him credit that he’s doing this,” mr. sykes said. “he’s willing to do some things that might be somewhat at odds with his public image. ” the letters     culled from personal and public archives     reveal mr. trump’s insecurities, but also his perceptiveness about power, ego and what motivates people. from early on, he seemed to intuitively grasp the potency of his praise when lavished on   men. in the 1990s, mr. trump occasionally fawned over new york’s brash mayor, rudolph w. giuliani. in one letter, mr. trump tore out a page from a magazine interview in which he had called mr. giuliani “the greatest mayor that the city’s ever had. ” in case mr. giuliani missed the homage, mr. trump drew two bold arrows, each pointing at the glowing passage, and reiterated the message in a handwritten note: “rudy, you are the greatest!” he wrote, adding, “see you soon. ” there is never any question about authorship: mr. trump’s style of writing sounds virtually identical to his hyperbolic manner of speech, with a healthy sprinkling of the words “great” and “tremendous,” abundant displays of   and    claims of success or doom. in a 1985 letter to mayor edward i. koch, mr. trump predicted new york city’s imminent downfall if a fellow real estate developer, arthur e. imperatore sr. were allowed to start a ferry service between new jersey and manhattan. “real estate values and taxes in new york would plummet,” mr. trump prognosticated darkly. “why would anyone want to live or shop in new york?” (mr. imperatore started the ferry service without destroying new york’s economy.) as a writer, mr. trump sometimes reached, awkwardly but earnestly, for eloquence. in a 1983 letter to a. m. rosenthal, then the executive editor of the times and a lunch companion, mr. trump turned poetic as he tried to capture his reaction to an article that mr. rosenthal had written about returning to  poland for the first time in decades. “it is moving it is sad it is hopeful (?) it is devastating,” mr. trump wrote, saying that his wife at the time, ivana, who grew up in eastern europe, agreed. “it truly captured the strength, the will and the soul of the polish people,” mr. trump wrote. he could write with striking tenderness to ivana, according to notes reviewed by the times. “i adore and love my little darling,” he wrote to her in one. “i truly believe that you are the greatest,” he wrote in another. on the page, anyway, mr. trump was even capable of humility, describing himself as a scribe of “little talent” in a 1985 note to arthur ochs sulzberger, then the publisher of the times. (mr. trump had an agenda: to complain about a reporter he disliked.) mr. trump traces his epistolary habits to his attempt to win over franklin m. jarman, who controlled a manhattan department store that mr. trump wanted to buy in the 1970s to make way for trump tower. mr. jarman rarely replied to mr. trump’s letters, but he had, in fact, read them, mr. trump wrote in his book “the art of the deal,” laying the groundwork for an agreement. “the letters i wrote eventually did have an impact,” mr. trump said. for years, mr. trump sent his letters the   way, by mail. but over time, members of his staff dragged him into the internet era     sort of. he still writes by hand, brandishing the favored tool of teachers’ corrections and athletes’ autographs, a black sharpie. now his aides often turn the letters into digital files, scanning them and sending them by email. but he refuses to let anyone else do the writing. “if i had a secretary to do them,” he said in an interview, “they wouldn’t be nearly as effective, they wouldn’t be nearly as sharp. ” each letter concludes with his extravagant signature, which resembles a city skyline or “a seismograph,” as graydon carter, the editor of vanity fair and a repeat recipient of mr. trump’s screeds, described it. many of his letters targeted the famous and credentialed, but from time to time they reached the little known and uninfluential. mr. trump penned a letter of encouragement in 2014 to an    student in texas, john russell niederer, who had expressed a desire to meet him. “work hard and be smart,” mr. trump told him. the letter now hangs on mr. niederer’s bedroom wall. “for him to take the time to send a message to somebody like me,” he said, “was really, really cool. ” a vindictive side is never far from view in mr. trump’s correspondence. after the basketball legend kareem   wrote a critical essay in the washington post about mr. trump’s candidacy, mr. trump sent him a copy of the essay with a biting message sprawled across it. “now i know why the press always treated you so badly     they couldn’t stand you,” mr. trump wrote. “the fact is that you don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make america great again!” mr.   said he was flabbergasted. “it was such a petty and childish reaction, like a teenage boy responding to being turned down for a date by whining, ‘well, nobody likes you!’ ” he said. he likened mr. trump’s decision to write his reply on the original article to “a dog urinating on a tree to mark its territory. ” mr.   had to get rid of the letter. “i crumpled it up real nice and tight and skyhooked it into my wastepaper basket,” he recalled, invoking his trademark shot. others cannot let go. “i’m definitely going to keep it,” mr. sykes, the radio host, said of his letter. “probably in a desk drawer. ”, Michael Barbaro, 6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.334079\n",
      "(york, pa.     senator patrick j. toomey, republican of pennsylvania, has never met charles kress, but he desperately needs him. mr. kress, 62, will vote for a democrat this november for the white house, he said, no matter what. he is also planning to vote for mr. toomey’s  . “sometimes you have to keep in office the ones who make the deals,” mr. kress said as he watered the flowers in front of york’s unitarian church. republican senators like mr. toomey who are running in swing states     about six, and enough to tip the balance of power in the senate     need voters who would reject donald j. trump to nonetheless pull the levers for the party’s other candidates in november. in some districts, house republicans will need them, too. mr. trump’s convincing sweep of the primaries in connecticut, delaware, maryland, pennsylvania and rhode island on tuesday did little to assuage concerns about his standing with swing voters in november. his victory speech included a bracing broadside against hillary clinton’s playing the “woman card. ” and he continues to trail his opponents, senator ted cruz of texas and gov. john kasich of ohio, among republican women. but   voters in federal races have become increasingly rare over the last two decades, hitting a low in 2012, when only 10 percent of them divided their votes between parties. that was down sharply from 1972. the ranks of   voters have expanded along with the rise in partisanship and its attendant rancor in congress. “there is no doubt that, over all, the era of polarization and   above and beyond idiosyncratic factors     that has to lead to a drop in ticket splitting,” said richard born, a professor of political science at vassar college and an expert on congressional elections. “democrats and republicans alike, as part of the polarization phenomenon, are more consistently liberal or conservative across issues,” mr. born said, “as are the candidates themselves, meaning less likelihood of ticket splitting. ” even in pennsylvania, a state that has elected a senator from a different party than the presidential candidate it chose seven times since world war ii, ticket splitting has decreased drastically in recent elections. “that is probably toomey’s worst problem,” said g. terry madonna, the director of the center for politics and public affairs at franklin and marshall college. it is also a problem for the republican senators kelly ayotte of new hampshire, ron johnson of wisconsin, mark s. kirk of illinois and rob portman of ohio. republicans in washington are increasingly worried for them. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader, and other republicans are openly urging elected officials in their party to focus largely on local issues and their role in bipartisan legislation, and to refrain from tying themselves to the top of the ticket should the nominee be mr. trump. “i think we have to go out and make a case,” said representative scott perry, a republican who represents the york area. “people don’t split their tickets because they don’t have a choice. it’s because they do. i think those people are going to need to be convinced. ” while a polarizing presidential candidate is considered very difficult for republican senators to overcome in swing states, there may be a silver lining for them. some republican donors are quietly plotting to dismiss mr. trump and instead pour their money into senate races where they believe republicans can be saved, as a check and balance to a democrat sitting in the white house for the next four years. “the prospect of trump at the top of the ticket could create an exodus of donors away from the presidential and toward senate and house races,” said kevin madden, a republican strategist. “the potential is there for a concentration of effort and resources geared toward senate races that chuck schumer and his senate democrats may not have been counting on. ” mr. schumer, a new yorker who is poised to become the next leader of the senate democrats, says good luck with that. “if there was ever a national election, this is it,” he said. “they can run from their nominee, but they can’t hide. ” ticket splitting over the last five decades has occurred most often among moderate democrats who have supported a republican for president but voted for democrats for congress. some voters have viewed this as a recipe for compromise and balance, while others have been repelled by the democratic candidates running for the top job. the three strongest years of ticket splitting between presidential and house voting in the last five decades, according to american national election studies survey data, were 1972, when 30 percent of voters did it 1980 (28 percent) and 1984 (26 percent). similar studies show the same trend for senate races. in all three of those elections, a republican won the white house by a landslide at a time when registered democrats significantly outnumbered republicans in the overall population, and when considerably more incumbent house members were democrats. the 1928 election provides a history lesson in what can happen when a candidate, rather than the political mood, drives ticket splitting. that year, al smith, the governor of new york, became the democratic nominee. it was not extreme rhetoric like mr. trump engages in, which has repelled some republicans, that held mr. smith back with voters. mr. smith was a roman catholic, opposed prohibition and was a symbol of modern urbanism. and that combination drove off rural and moderate southern democrats, who outnumbered republicans significantly, contributing to his loss to the republican herbert hoover. while republicans made a net gain of eight seats in the senate that year, demonstrating that ticket splitting does not help all senators attached to the party of a wildly unpopular candidate, many democrats still voted along party lines for the house and senate. in 1996, when it was clear that bill clinton would trounce bob dole, republicans encouraged voters to stick with their party in the down ballot, and newt gingrich, then speaker of the house, cautioned his members to distance themselves from mr. dole. mr. gingrich came up with a parallel house agenda much as speaker paul d. ryan is now doing, and he told members to run on it. “it saved the house and the senate for them,” said mr. born, the vassar professor. “trying to localize the campaigns paid off. ” but republican ticket splitters may make an alternative choice that is equally damaging to mr. toomey’s prospects. “i might just skip the whole thing,” said kristi peyton, 46, a toomey fan who offered her views of mr. trump     “disaster,” “bully” and “unattractive”     over crabs at captain

      "(philadelphia     from the time donald j. trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional republicans treated his policy pronouncements     largely out of step with republican dogma     as essentially a distraction. he would talk. they would drive the policies. but now, the question of whether congressional republicans would change president trump or mr. trump would change them has an early answer. mr. trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in flint, mich. they also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that mr. trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5, 000 more border patrol agents. they have stayed oddly silent as mr. trump and senate democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from president barack obama. once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, republicans are now embracing mr. trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during mr. obama’s second term. speaker paul d. ryan, whose own website this week still praised the   partnership trade deal, now applauds mr. trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. many republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, mr. trump’s embrace of both. even on the subject of mr. trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, republicans have often demurred. “the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell of kentucky. mr. trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. “this congress is going to be the busiest congress we’ve had in decades, maybe ever,” mr. trump said. in an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, “we’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. you’re not wasting your time. ” many republicans in congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the obama administration’s decisions to halt the keystone xl and dakota access pipeline projects. “i think he’s completely winning the expectation game,” said representative peter roskam of illinois. “i think he’s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,” he said, adding, “it’s really remarkable. ” in one significant way, congressional republicans potentially seemed to pull mr. trump to their end of the policy pool. on thursday, the administration initially  appeared to endorse  taxing imports as a way to pay for the mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. but the white house later said it was just one option under consideration. “we are in a very good place on tax reform,” mr. ryan said. “it can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it’s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, i think most people agree that this is the right approach. ” congressional republicans are also struggling to keep up with mr. trump’s   announcements, let alone push their agenda. “it’s   stuff,” said senator john hoeven, republican of north dakota. investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see congress take on. “our priorities are the ones we laid out,” he said. they are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda     specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the affordable care act. “we are on the same page with the white house,” mr. ryan insisted thursday. “the president agrees with this agenda. ” but it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation. and the list is much longer. by contrast, last year, senator john cornyn of texas, the no. 2 senate republican, called democrats’ request for $600 million in aid to flint added to an energy bill “a huge earmark,” adding, “i think it’s not something i could support,” in keeping with most of his colleagues. republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight zika last year. the talk of a spending surge has left some republicans worried about an exploding deficit. “there are going to have to be some cuts,” said representative jason chaffetz of utah. “i am not interested in raising our spending levels. ” senator john barrasso of wyoming, the chairman of the environment and public works committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. “we’re a fiscally conservative group,” he said of the committee. “we’re going to want to see things paid for. ” republicans are also at times confused about what mr. trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on twitter. “‘appears’ i think is the big word,” said representative ryan costello of pennsylvania. “i don’t think anyone in the house of representatives on the republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,” only to have the trump administration send a bill back, he said. republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the house continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later. also notable is the republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised: the use of the executive pen to make policy. several house republicans dismissed the notion that mr. trump would abuse his power to issue executive orders in the way they complained that mr. obama did during his second term. “what you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,” said representative tom reed of new york. mr. trump is also trying to work his will on how the senate operates. in an interview with sean hannity on fox news, mr. trump said he thought mr. mcconnell should get rid of the senate filibuster rule for supreme court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick “obstructionists. ” about three blocks from where mr. trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from city hall to rally against the president. while the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. “i don’t trust anything he says,” said ken snyder, 62., Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(tucson, ariz.     senator john mccain does not say much these days about donald j. trump’s attack on his   years as a prisoner of war. instead, he clenches his teeth and says he will support the republican party’s presumptive nominee, who once said derisively about the senator’s time in captivity, “i like people that weren’t captured. ” in the   swelter here in arizona, his home state, mr. mccain, who was the republicans’ presidential nominee and   in 2008, did not openly bemoan this moment from his long political life. he is focusing on what he considers his toughest   fight yet, and is betting that the only way to keep his seat is to support mr. trump. “i’m fair game. i’m in the arena,” said mr. mccain, 79, whose thinning face reflects the decades he has spent traveling around his massive and increasingly diverse state. still, the episode sits with traces of bitterness, like old coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup, even if he says otherwise. for a moment, the july attack on mr. mccain seemed to be mr. trump’s undoing. mccain said he recalled a recent chat with a world war ii veteran who had been in a german prison camp. as he delivered the man a missing medal, “he said to me, ‘why would trump say something like that about us?’ ” the senator said. “frankly, i didn’t have an answer for it. ” but mr. trump has since called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a wall at the mexican border, and now the billionaire businessman could be the force that ultimately topples the indomitable mr. mccain. an estimated 433, 000 hispanics are expected to vote in arizona this november, an 8 percent increase from 2012. and mr. mccain has a credible democratic challenger, representative ann kirkpatrick, who grew up on an indian reservation and has strong support from the state’s sizable native american population. “i just came from a latino round table, and they are really concerned about mccain’s support for trump,” she said tuesday. “it’s very personal here. ” she is working with the state’s democrats to harness these forces against mr. mccain and his old guard, which is largely behind mr. trump. ms. kirkpatrick said that being   “is a strong message,” but she acknowledged that “it’s not the only message. ” she recently opened a field office in tempe, and has many arizona state university volunteers working the phones. working out of an old bank, aides sit in the former vault (the door has been removed) to go over mr. mccain’s statements, year by year, and look for inconsistencies that suggest too long a stay in congress. “the race comes down to whether arizonans take a step back and judge john mccain for being john mccain and his remarkable life of public service,” said grant woods, a former state attorney general and the senator’s friend for decades. “and not as being a   incumbent, and not as a republican in a year when the party has a controversial nominee. if they do that, he will win walking away. if they don’t, then it could be tight. could he lose? yeah. ” despite the personal attacks by mr. trump on the senator’s integrity and war record, mr. mccain cannot afford to reject mr. trump and alienate his many supporters in arizona if he hopes to hold his seat, an agonizing  . mr. mccain is the embodiment of much that voters in both parties, but especially fans of mr. trump, have said they would like to jettison this year. he is the ultimate establishment player, having served in congress for nearly four decades     five terms in the senate alone. “back in the middle ages, i was known as the maverick,” mr. mccain said, smiling wanly. he is an unapologetic free trader, an interventionist abroad who continues to defend the deeply unpopular war in iraq, a supporter of private industry and markets, and the original, if inconstant, champion of changes to the immigration system that would help some illegal immigrants become citizens. to succeed in what most people believe will be his last political campaign, mr. mccain must canter around the state assuring mr. trump’s detractors that he does not share the businessman’s visions for mass deportation and the dissolution of nato, while continuing to woo an angry republican base that overwhelmingly voted for mr. trump in the state’s march primary. “i’ve been feeling it out there for some time,” mr. mccain said. “in the southern part of the state here, they are not feeling the recovery at all. then there is this whole issue with these young people and kids carrying around all this debt. ” “that’s the bernie effect,” he said, referring to senator bernie sanders’s youth appeal in the democratic primaries. he added: “the turmoil in this race is more than i’ve ever seen. younger, newer voters are registering for only one reason, to vote against trump. so my challenge is to convince that younger, newer voter that i am for them. ” his greater challenge may be with latinos angry at mr. trump. according to an analysis of voter and census data by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials educational fund, latinos are expected to account for 17 percent of arizona’s registered electorate this year, with a voter turnout rate at close to 70 percent. nearly 45 percent of latino registered voters are democrats, the report found. “i’ve always spent a lot of time with the hispanic community,” mr. mccain said, “but having said that, they are rising in numbers in the voting population. i’m putting more emphasis there, particularly in light of trump’s comments. ” hispanics in the phoenix area will also be heavily motivated to vote in the sheriff’s election joe arpaio, a trump supporter who was recently found in contempt of court for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining latinos, will be on the ballot, trying to keep his seat as maricopa county sheriff. a day watching mr. mccain campaign here this past week reflects his evolving challenges. he sat for the endorsement of a small group of border patrol agents, who have also endorsed mr. trump, and listened in silence as art del cueto, the president of tucson local 2455 of the national border patrol council, explained why mr. trump had gotten their approval. “it means so much to me this long relationship we’ve had,” mr. mccain said about his endorsement, “and the support we’ve tried to provide. ” mr. del cueto did say that “we did talk to donald” about his comments concerning mr. mccain’s war record. “i don’t think it was a comment that has been made again,” he said. but a bit later, meeting with hispanic business leaders, mr. mccain opened with “we’re going to make america great again and it’s going to be huge, o. k.?” it was a tiny swipe at mr. trump, taken in the manner of a toddler grabbing a cookie when he assumes no one is looking. then it was on to other topics, like the federal aviation administration reauthorization. mr. mccain remains most at home with other veterans, like the one he visited     on memorial day, another man waiting on medals. “his wife said he was staying alive to get those medals,” mr. mccain said, smiling at the memory. “sometimes it’s a nice job. ”,

      "(a look at the political math in six states where tight races could determine control of the senate: north carolina senator richard burr, a republican, was thought to be a safe bet for   against deborah ross, his democratic challenger, who is a former state representative and head of the state’s chapter of the american civil liberties union. but north carolina has been roiled by a fight over bathroom rights for transgender people that has affected almost every campaign. the national republican party has swooped in to try to save mr. burr’s bid. _____ pennsylvania  katie mcginty, a democrat, is trying to become pennsylvania’s first female senator with a bid to unseat senator patrick j. toomey, a republican who has managed to keep a moderate image around the state because of a (failed) gun safety bill that bore his name. hillary clinton’s coattails     and donald j. trump’s anvil     have made a difference here. _____ new hampshire  senator kelly ayotte, a republican, is suffering from an uncomfortable association with mr. trump, most notably when she had to release a statement walking back her suggestion during a debate that mr. trump was a role model for children. gov. maggie hassan, her democratic challenger, is getting major assistance from national party figures like vice president joseph r. biden jr. and senator bernie sanders in what is widely viewed as the closest senate race in the country. _____ missouri senator roy d. blunt was on no lists of endangered incumbents. then his democratic challenger, jason kander, an afghanistan veteran who is missouri’s secretary of state, conjured up an ad in which he assembled an assault rifle blindfolded while speaking of gun rights. it was a clever way to both fend off attacks over gun control and underscore mr. blunt’s vietnam deferments in a very   state. mr. blunt’s decades of service in washington are also out of style this year. _____ indiana  evan bayh, a democrat, is trying to reclaim his senate seat but is finding that his time as a washington insider is a serious liability. representative todd young, with the help of millions of dollars in outside money, is painting a dark picture of mr. bayh as a greedy lobbyist who abandoned his voters, and mr. bayh’s   lead has shrunk significantly. indiana is trump country, and mr. bayh, who was once a very popular governor, is going to need republican voters who remember him fondly to split their tickets. _____ nevada for a while, it did not seem that catherine cortez masto, a democrat who is a former state attorney general, would catch up to representative joe heck, a republican who seemed a good fit for his state and this cycle. but mr. heck, by turning away from mr. trump after the presidential candidate was heard bragging about sexual assault in a 2005 recording, began to lose some of his base support, living every republican candidate’s nightmare. the hispanic vote, important here, is hard to poll. but ms. cortez masto is now narrowly ahead in the race, a battle for the seat of senator harry reid in which the retiring democratic leader has unleashed his political machine in support of her., Jennifer

      "(washington     the most powerful and ambitious   congress in 20 years will convene tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of american life     refashioning the country’s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the obama administration. even before   donald j. trump is sworn in on jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities     most notably a measure to clear a path for the affordable care act’s repeal. perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new congress is the push for deregulation. also up early: filling a   supreme court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for mr. trump’s cabinet nominees. “it’s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,” said senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader. “and we intend to do it. ” but as republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of congress for their more partisan goals, democrats are preparing roadblocks. the party’s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of russian election interference, mr. trump’s   cabinet picks and his taunting twitter posts. (on saturday, he offered new year’s wishes “to all,” including “those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. ”) obstacles will also come from republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. and any burst of legislative action will come only if congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. for republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved     the house in particular has signaled the republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. but many of those measures have gathered dust in the senate or been doused in veto ink. the cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent house republican majority in the  . speaker newt gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the senate majority leader, bob dole, who stacked conservative house bills like so many fire logs in the back of the senate chamber. “they’ve been given a golden opportunity here,” said trent lott, the former republican senate majority leader. “but i have watched over the years when one party has had control of the white house and the senate and the house, and the danger is overplaying your hand. “if you go too far, like what happened with obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,” mr. lott continued. “you have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ” the tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the senate finance committee is already moving in that direction. still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from mr. trump’s chief of staff, reince priebus. the senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for mr. trump. republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. but on many issues, senate democrats     including their new leader, chuck schumer of new york     are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of mr. trump’s agenda. “after campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   trump’s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he’s sworn in,” said senator patty murray, democrat of washington. “democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ” republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that president obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the trump team on which ones should be undone. “i hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,” the house speaker, paul d. ryan of wisconsin, said at a recent forum. “i think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ” in late december, the obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. that regulation, one of dozens that mr. trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. but congress is likely to block it, using the obscure congressional review act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules’ completion. given time constraints on the senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. they are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. republicans will also move quickly to repeal the affordable care act. they plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year     already a quarter over     that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any democratic filibuster. but republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace mr. obama’s, and they may delay the repeal measure’s effective date for years. the senate must also consider mr. trump’s cabinet picks, and senate democrats are already trying to slow the process. however, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than supreme court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with mr. trump’s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. republicans have been particularly upset that senator jeff sessions of alabama, whom mr. trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with democrats on the senate judiciary committee or had meetings canceled. senator dianne feinstein of california postponed her meeting with mr. sessions until january because, she said, her schedule got too busy. “the senator doesn’t want to rush,” said her spokesman, tom mentzer. one reason that democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over mr. mcconnell’s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the supreme court nomination of judge merrick b. garland. lingering in the background is the specter of russia. democrats     and some republicans, who are at odds with mr. trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him     want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. the obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. while republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party’s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. “this is no time for hubris,” mr. mcconnell said. “you have to perform. ”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)

      "(’’ ’yahoo ceo marissa mayer promised  the hip blogging site, when she acquired it for $1. 1 billion in 2013.’ ”but on tuesday, yahoo acknowledged that the acquisition hasn’t quite been the success it had hoped.” ”yahoo took a $230 million write down on tumblr and said that the site hadn’t met its revenue targets.” ’the write down was part of a hefty $4. 5 billion goodwill impairment that yahoo recorded  with much of the charges stemming from its businesses in the us, europe, canada and latin america. ’ ’yahoo noted that $3. 3 billion of the write downs were from acquisitions that occured before 2012, meaning that they were deals that were done before mayer was ceo. ’ ’yahoo cfo ken goldman said that tumblr had missed its 2015 revenue target, which called for the site to generate $100 million. ’ ”yahoo isn’t giving up on tumblr. in fact, tumblr is one of the three pillars that yahoo is building  as the company announced on tuesday. ” ’but the fact that it is writing down some of tumblr is an acknowledgment that the biggest and flashiest acquisition made by mayer has not lived up to expectations. ’, Alexei Oreskovic, 0)

      "(’  ’ ’   twitter, which was once a darling of the tech industry and went   public almost three years ago in an   ipo, . ’ ”   we’ve seen this story with an internet company before. ” ’   in fact, the parallels between twitter and yahoo are rather   striking: ’ ’   a rotating cast of ceos and executives with little   direction; a powerful platform once seen as the future of the   internet struggling with an identity crisis; questionable   strategies for growth. ’ ”   if it doesn’t sell soon, twitter risks setting itself up for   yahoo’s same fate: a   stagnation in which no   progress is made, and company focus and morale are slowly   drained by   takeover talks. the story ends   with a desperate sale for a tiny fraction of its peak   valuation. ” ”   right now, twitter seems to think it can fetch as much as   $30 billion in a sale, about double its market cap as of friday,   . yahoo,    agreed to sell to verizon for $4. 8 billion this year. that was   8 years after microsoft offered to buy yahoo for $42   billion     an offer that yahoo’s leadership stubbornly   rebuffed.  ” ”   if ceo jack dorsey and the twitter board pull a yahoo from 2008,   they’re setting themselves up for a . ” ”   twitter would also be taking a gamble if it doesn’t sell and   tries to make it on its own. as  one option the company is   considering other than a sale is a restructuring that could   include layoffs. but we’ve seen twitter go through that before,   and it hasn’t helped solve its user growth problems. as the   saying goes     and as yahoo proved through many rounds of layoffs   and endless restructurings     you can’t cut your way to   growth. ” ’  ’ ”   despite its many problems, twitter is still an attractive asset.   it’s an invaluable tool for news gatherers, celebrities, world   leaders, activists and marketers. it has a treasure trove of   untapped data, which probably looks pretty tasty to companies   like google and salesforce. twitter was the platform that a   reality tv    tycoon used to promote himself all   the way to the gop nomination for the presidency. no one can deny   the power and influence twitter wields, even with   its relatively small base of active users.  ” ”   but twitter’s company culture has always prided itself on being   fiercely independent. the company turned down an offer from   facebook in its early days. ” ”   and while cofounder dorsey doesn’t control a majority of   twitter’s voting shares (as facebook’s mark zuckerberg and   google’s larry page and sergey brin do) it’s not clear how   amenable dorsey might be to selling out     or how vigorously he   might try to oppose a deal. ” ”   depending on who the buyer is, an acquisition might not be at   odds with twitter’s mission. unlike yahoo, which seems   destined to be   for valuable resources and left   unrecognizable once verizon gains jurisdiction over it, twitter’s   service could actually flourish under a parent company that   provides additional resources and leeway.  ” ’  ’ ’     ’, Steve Kovach, 8)

      "(washington     he didn’t see it coming. speaker paul d. ryan was in a hotel room in cincinnati last may when he learned that donald j. trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the republican nomination for president. mr. trump had recently lost the wisconsin primary, which mr. ryan and other republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. senator ted cruz of texas had made strides, and mr. ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. but he badly miscalculated. the ensuing path, from mr. trump’s securing the nomination to mr. ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in wisconsin a month before election day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that mr. trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. mr. ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of reince priebus, chairman of the republican national committee and a fellow wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to mr. trump. now, mr. ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve republican control of congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. if mr. trump is defeated on nov. 8     as mr. ryan has all but conceded     but republicans maintain their house majority, it will fall largely to mr. ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. there is, of course, the question of whether house members would let him do so. the republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the house decision on whether the speaker should be mr. ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies trumpism. democrats have moved quickly to paint mr. ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of mr. trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying mr. ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. on saturday, mr. ryan’s office added to that criticism of mr. trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for mr. ryan. for his part, mr. trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of mr. ryan. last week, in a series of twitter posts, he called mr. ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee. ” for now, the speaker spends his days treating mr. trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of hillary clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered house republicans. “right now his objective is crystal clear,” said representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma, “to retain the republican majority in the house. in that effort he has helped members of the freedom caucus as well as those in the tuesday group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “we will worry about our internal differences after the election. right now we are in a bar fight and every republican is worth saving. ” that mr. ryan and mr. trump were never natural allies is understandable. they had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the white house, an encounter at a   in new york during the 2012 campaign. mr. ryan was mitt romney’s running mate. their paths would not cross again. “trump really wasn’t on paul’s radar screen,” said a. mark neuman, a ryan friend for two decades. “before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that mr. trump did not share mr. ryan’s passions for the green bay packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and midwest life with children. the relationship showed strains from the start, with mr. ryan alarmed by mr. trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. the speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to mr. trump for other republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “if we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. he made calls to several of the republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda mr. trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (the trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. mr. ryan also declined to be interviewed.) mr. ryan had hoped that mr. trump would eventually embrace his plan. when mr. trump clinched the nomination in may, mr. ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “the conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘don’t worry, this will end,’” said charlie sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in milwaukee and a friend of mr. ryan’s. “so it was a huge shock. i think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” with campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, mr. ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse mr. trump. none of this pleased mr. priebus, who prided himself on building the modern republican party in wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against mrs. clinton. in text messages and phone calls, mr. priebus tried to persuade mr. ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept mr. trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. mr. trump would yell at mr. priebus and in turn mr. priebus would needle mr. ryan. when that did not work, mr. trump claimed mr. ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to capitol hill to try to woo fellow republicans, a claim mr. ryan viewed as a serious breach. “that was the first realization that trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate mr. trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” in june, after a period of relative silence on mr. trump’s part, mr. ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. staff members of both men began to coordinate for the republican national convention. but days later mr. ryan aggressively criticized mr. trump for his remarks about a hispanic judge. another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “he was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” mr. sykes said. a bright spot came in july, when mr. trump chose indiana’s governor, mike pence, who has long been close to mr. ryan, as his running mate. privately, mr. pence tried to assure skeptical republicans that he would impose mr. ryan’s policy agenda if he and mr. trump captured the white house. then in august, mr. trump toyed with endorsing mr. ryan’s opponent in a primary. mr. ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. he watched mr. trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. mr. trump called mr. ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of mr. pence, and to seek debate advice, which mr. ryan said focused on preparation. (not heeded.) by the fall, mr. ryan had basically stopped speaking mr. trump’s name. the nominee made a request through the r. n. c. to campaign with mr. ryan, whose team agreed to invite mr. trump and mr. pence to an event this month in wisconsin. then came the tape of mr. trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. mr. sykes let mr. priebus know via text that mr. trump was no longer welcome in wisconsin. mr. sykes said mr. priebus responded: “i am the guy trying to fix this! i am in tears over this. ’” (a spokeswoman for mr. priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) mr. ryan agonized over his options. ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “i think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said representative jason chaffetz, republican of utah, who has renounced mr. trump. “his job is to help house republicans. period. ” mr. ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support mr. trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “we knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” mr. sykes said. “how much damage could they do?”, Jennifer Steinhauer, 4)    0.291952\n",
      "(’  ’ ’   over four years ago, google launched a bold evolution of search   called google now. google now wasn’t the search you were used to.   instead of a list of results to your queries, you got the single   answer you were looking for. ’ ’   how old is barack obama? what time is the super bowl? when was   the last time the mets won the world series? ’ ’   you always got the answer. ’ ’   and even better, google now was proactive, bringing you the   information you wanted before you even knew you wanted it. your   flight is delayed. traffic is bad, so you’d better leave a few   minutes early if you want to make it to work on time. your   favorite team lost again. ’ ’   google now felt like the future at a time when apple was still   trying to get siri to understand you when you asked it 2+2. ’ ’   on tuesday, google kicked it into high gear. ’ ’   at its big product launch event, google now officially became     with google assistant, the next evolution of its   ai. ’ ’   we got an early look at assistant in  google’s new messaging app that launched a few weeks   ago, but tuesday’s event showed us google’s true vision for its   new ai helper. assistant will be everywhere, helping you out no   matter what gadget or app you’re using. ’ ’   and according to google ceo sundar pichai, it’ll keep getting   smarter the more you use it, to the point that it’ll be so   customized to the user that there will be a unique google   assistant for everyone. ’ ’   it may not be a new idea     all the major tech companies from   microsoft to amazon to facebook have their own ai assistants       but it is a category google is uniquely qualified to dominate. ’ ’  ’ ’   after all these years, google continues to embarrass the   competition. while assistant can tap into the world’s knowledge,   siri struggles to answer even the simplest queries. i recently   asked both ais when tuesday’s vice presidential debates start.   google assistant told me 9 p. m. eastern. siri gave me a list of   search results about the election from bing. that’s just one   example, but if you use google assistant often enough, you   realize just how far ahead it is. ’ ’   then there’s the new google home speaker, a competitor to   amazon’s surprise hit echo speaker. while the echo is a great   device, google’s demo of home already felt ahead of what amazon   has pulled off so far. of course, it can play music and control   smart appliances. but it also intelligently answers questions   better than amazon’s alexa. and overall, echo can’t do half of   the things we saw home do on tuesday. ’ ’   google has literally built a multibillion dollar business on its   ability to answer questions. (pichai said tuesday google’s   knowledge graph is loaded with a growing library of 70 billion   facts.) now it’s focusing that expertise on ai that will be with   you no matter where you are. your home. your car. your phone. and   soon, everywhere else. ’ ’   the ai assistant race is the next major battle in personal   computing, and assistant is the first step towards that       computer. it

      "(’  ’ ’   google held a splashy press event in san francisco on   tuesday to unveil  including a      phone called the pixel, a   virtual reality headset   called daydream view, an amazon echo competitor called google   home, and a home wifi system known as google wifi. ’ ”   unlike google’s past dalliances in hardware, this time all the   products are under one division, led by former motorola president   rick osterloh, and they seemed more coherently tied together than   ever before.  ” ’   for instance, google’’s intelligent agent, the google assistant,   shows up in both the wifi connected ”home” speaker and in the new   pixel phone, although you activate it slightly differently     with   home, you have to say ”okay google” every time, while the pixel   simply lets you press and hold the home software button. the   pixels are the first (and so far only) phones to work with the   daydream headset. you can get a daydream view and a base for   the home in the same   color called ”snow.” ’ ”   the products themselves also seemed solid when i tried them   in google’s demo area, although we haven’t had a chance to review   them independently. ” ’   the home smart speaker really does understand if you ask it to   ”play that smashmouth song from shrek,” or tell it to turn down   your nest thermostat     i was particularly impressed at how well   it picked up our voice commands in a crowded and noisy space. the   pixel looks as good as any other   smartphone. the   daydream view may make you look like a dork (like all   vr viewers) but it’’s got some smart design touches, like   the little cubby where you tuck the remote control, and it comes   in some cool colors and is covered with a pleasant soft fabric. ’ ’  ’ ”   all that aside, i still think google’s heart is elsewhere.   why? ” ”   perhaps most telling, when google ceo sundar pichai was talking   today, he didn’t show the kind of excitement   and energy he shows at google   the company’s annual   event for developers. pichai is a software developer; those are   his people. he was most animated during a long diversion   about about google’s machine learning prowess in translating   english to chinese     a tough problem, but a software engineering   problem, not a hardware problem.  ” ’  ’ ’   google hardware boss  on tuesday   that the company was serious about hardware this time and is in   it for the long haul. ’ ”   but in fact, the best part of these google hardware products   isn’t the hardware. it’s the software and services that underpin   them     the brains behind the google assistant, the unlimited   photo storage for the pixel provided by google’s cloud, the   daydream virtual reality platform that third parties will be able   to use to create 3d content. ” ”   so this is not google turning into apple. it’s   more akin to google following microsoft when it started   doing hardware in 2010 to help show what windows 8 was capable of   on touch screen devices. microsoft does take hardware seriously.   it has some excellent designers. it’s making some very   strong products and . ” ”   but it’s hardware in service of microsoft’s other products and   its broader strategy of productivity everywhere, not hardware for   its own sake. ” ”   that’s the template google is following. google’s broader   strategy is providing access to all the world’s information, and   selling advertisements against the attention consumers pay to get   that information. consumers or investors who think otherwise risk   confusion and disappointment. ”,

      "(’  ’ ”   this week didn’t look good for apple. ” ”   google’s new pixel phone launched to positive reviews,   largely because of the phone’s new digital helper called   google assistant. ” ’   as i  of the new google pixel, it’s relatively easy to   make a   smartphone these days. the real challenge is   lighting it up with unique software that helps you do more. ’ ’   and the new google assistant accomplishes just that. ’ ’   right out of the gate, assistant is noticeably smarter and more   capable than siri, a stark embarrassment for apple, which had a     head start on google. ai and voice control are   considered to be the next big step in how we compute (just look   at the early success of the amazon echo) and google has already   pulled ahead. ’ ’’ ’   assistant is so good because it taps into google’s vast   network of products and culls them together into a single,     app. the more google services like calendar, photos,   and gmail you use, the smarter assistant gets. ’ ’   it’s also better at answering questions than the competition,   thanks to its ability to tap into google’s vast knowledge graph   and deliver the single answer to the question you   ask. google assistant has so many impressive skills that   it’s impossible to list them all now. ’ ’   i’m still discovering new capabilities after almost two weeks   with the pixel. here’s how i put it : ’ ’   the shame here is that siri had a   head start on google   assistant, and apple totally blew it. siri struggles to answer   even the simplest of queries. it wasn’t until two tech columnists    that siri quickly learned   the answers to some of the . curious! ’ ’   the reality is apple can’t be reactive and improve siri every   time someone blogs about its flaws.  ’ ’   luckily, the pieces are in place, as apple has acquired a series   of ai and machine learning companies over the last year or so.   most notably, it bought the   startup vocal iq, which    had technology that allowed   users to control a phone or computer completely with voice. that   also jibes with apple’s   goal to make siri fully capable   of controlling the iphone within the next few years, as . ’ ’   but for now, google assistant is clearly in the lead, and that   lead will only get wider as more people use it and increases its   intelligence. ’, Steve Kovach, 8)

      "(’  ’ ’   twitter, which was once a darling of the tech industry and went   public almost three years ago in an   ipo, . ’ ”   we’ve seen this story with an internet company before. ” ’   in fact, the parallels between twitter and yahoo are rather   striking: ’ ’   a rotating cast of ceos and executives with little   direction; a powerful platform once seen as the future of the   internet struggling with an identity crisis; questionable   strategies for growth. ’ ”   if it doesn’t sell soon, twitter risks setting itself up for   yahoo’s same fate: a   stagnation in which no   progress is made, and company focus and morale are slowly   drained by   takeover talks. the story ends   with a desperate sale for a tiny fraction of its peak   valuation. ” ”   right now, twitter seems to think it can fetch as much as   $30 billion in a sale, about double its market cap as of friday,   . yahoo,    agreed to sell to verizon for $4. 8 billion this year. that was   8 years after microsoft offered to buy yahoo for $42   billion     an offer that yahoo’s leadership stubbornly   rebuffed.  ” ”   if ceo jack dorsey and the twitter board pull a yahoo from 2008,   they’re setting themselves up for a . ” ”   twitter would also be taking a gamble if it doesn’t sell and   tries to make it on its own. as  one option the company is   considering other than a sale is a restructuring that could   include layoffs. but we’ve seen twitter go through that before,   and it hasn’t helped solve its user growth problems. as the   saying goes     and as yahoo proved through many rounds of layoffs   and endless restructurings     you can’t cut your way to   growth. ” ’  ’ ”   despite its many problems, twitter is still an attractive asset.   it’s an invaluable tool for news gatherers, celebrities, world   leaders, activists and marketers. it has a treasure trove of   untapped data, which probably looks pretty tasty to companies   like google and salesforce. twitter was the platform that a   reality tv    tycoon used to promote himself all   the way to the gop nomination for the presidency. no one can deny   the power and influence twitter wields, even with   its relatively small base of active users.  ” ”   but twitter’s company culture has always prided itself on being   fiercely independent. the company turned down an offer from   facebook in its early days. ” ”   and while cofounder dorsey doesn’t control a majority of   twitter’s voting shares (as facebook’s mark zuckerberg and   google’s larry page and sergey brin do) it’s not clear how   amenable dorsey might be to selling out     or how vigorously he   might try to oppose a deal. ” ”   depending on who the buyer is, an acquisition might not be at   odds with twitter’s mission. unlike yahoo, which seems   destined to be   for valuable resources and left   unrecognizable once verizon gains jurisdiction over it, twitter’s   service could actually flourish under a parent company that   provides additional resources and leeway.  ” ’  ’ ’     ’, Steve Kovach, 8)

      "( (cnn) us intelligence agencies released on friday an alarming report about a hostile foreign country’s efforts to subvert america’s system of government, and the incoming president does not seem to understand the danger of the situation. in a   document, the country’s top intelligence experts declared that russian president vladimir putin ordered a campaign to influence the us presidential election. ”russia’s goals,” they concluded, ”were to undermine public faith in the us democratic process, denigrate secretary clinton, and harm her electability.”  this is an extraordinary accusation, and the intelligence chiefs are fully aware of that. it is not a     spying operation: it was a plot aimed at corroding the foundation of america’s system of government and    as the report puts it    upending ”the   liberal democratic order.” that means that russia’s objectives, despite trump’s victory, have not been fully achieved.   if that were not enough reason for alarm, trump’s reaction shows he either doesn’t comprehend the seriousness of the matter, he does not care or, perhaps, as some have suggested, he’s not committed to america’s democracy. in fact, it seems that the   is only able to view the issue through his  . somehow, he cannot look beyond the impact this has on his image as the winner of the election. that   view is in sharp contrast with republicans (and democrats) in congress who have managed to rise above partisanship to face up to what has just happened. while republican sen. john mccain called russia’s actions  ”an act of war,” and house speaker paul ryan, also a republican, acknowledged  that russia ”clearly tried to meddle in our political system,” trump is caught in his solipsistic house of mirrors.  just before receiving a classified briefing on the intelligence, the   gave a telephone interview to the new york times in which he belittled the significance what occurred and called the commotion surrounding the findings of russia’s hacking and other activities a political witch hunt by democrats embarrassed by their election loss.  after he was briefed by the intelligence chiefs, he accepted the possibility of a russian hack, but grudgingly and with no appearance that he grasped the magnitude and significance of what occurred. he released a statement saying he and the intelligence briefers had a ”constructive meeting,” but his statement’s principal thrust was the claim that, ”there was absolutely no effect on the [election] outcome whatsoever,” and no tampering with voting machines. huh? clearly, trump misses the point. this is not about him it is about protecting the country he has been elected to govern from an active and deliberate threat. in his statement, trump vowed to get tough on hacking from various countries, but did not indicate he viewed russia as the culprit in the election interference operation. the russian interference campaign, as it happens, was not just hacking, even if actions by russian and   hackers played a major part in the operation. russia’s activities    which we have seen targeting other western democracies    included a vast array of techniques.  hacking the democratic national committee and clinton campaign chief john podesta’s emails were important elements of the russian efforts. the report shows how the hack was carried out and how the documents were handed to wikileaks for dissemination. ”moscow’s influence campaign,” as the intelligence report calls it, blended a variety of means, including covert cyberactivity by russian intelligence operatives, along with ”with overt   media,   intermediaries, and paid social media users or ’trolls’.”  and there was trump himself, who peddled the material to his followers, making it sound as if the hacks contained truly explosive information.  all those clinton emails, in fact, were the least of it. few people read them, but many people believed the claim that they contained great and horrifying secrets.   the greater effort was in painting clinton as unfit to lead. putin, as we wrote months ago and as us intelligence experts concluded, ”developed a clear preference” for trump over clinton. when he thought clinton would win despite russia’s multipronged effort to cast doubt on her, the plan shifted to undercutting the credibility of the election.  the report says   government bloggers were all set to launch a #democracyrip campaign after a clinton win, to undercut the election’s credibility. curiously, trump had also strongly suggested that if he lost it would be because of fraud. putin made a big push to help trump win. he deployed his ”news” agencies, rt and sputnik, along with a vast social media machine to promote false accusations that clinton was corrupt, ill, mentally unstable and linked to islamist groups. as it happens, trump did the same, promoting precisely that unfounded description of his rival, all the way to electoral victory.  the looming question is what, if anything, trump will do to stop this russian assault on democracy. will he carry on his plan to repair relations with the kremlin without taking any action? will he lift the modest sanctions just imposed by president barack obama? trump concluded his statement today saying, ”america’s safety and security will be my number one priority.” what is not clear is whether american democracy is also a priority. the   is playing a risky game by downplaying this matter and resisting the intelligence community’s conclusions. even before he takes office, the issue has already opened a rift with fellow republicans, and it has raised piercing questions that he cannot afford to ignore.  as democratic whip steny hoyer said, trump’s continued  denial of russia’s intervention in the election, ”would raise questions about where his sympathies truly lie.”, Frida Ghitis, 2)    0.094061\n",
      "(’  ’ ”   donald trump’s strongest moment suddenly turned into one of his   weakest.  ” ’   hillary clinton was on the defensive. the candidates were talking   about immigration. one of  a   transcript of which was released as part of hacked clinton   campaign emails from wikileaks, was under the spotlight. ’ ’   then she changed the subject. ’ ’   she veered off the discussion of ”open borders,” which she had   praised in her speech, and instead started talking about russian   president vladimir putin. she accused putin and the russian   government of meddling in the us election, and called on   trump to disavow ”russian espionage against americans.” ’ ’   trump responded with a zinger, marveling at how clinton had   shifted gears. and then, for some reason, he took the bait. ’ ’’ ’   ”now we can talk about putin,” he started. ’ ”   it was a seminal, if unheralded, moment as part of clinton’s   master class in debate sparring with an unworthy partner. in   romping through the nominees’ three debates,  and opening up a more   and more sizable poll lead, she was the class president vs. the   class clown, the   interviewee vs. the guy winging it   on the biggest stage of his life. ” ”   clinton did what 16 republican candidates couldn’t in the gop   primary: beat trump at his own game. ” ’   she trolled him.  ’ ’   on wednesday, that came when she relentlessly needled him   over his meeting with the mexican president, which led to a   dispute over whether he had actually .  ’ ’   ”he choked and then got into a twitter war,” she said. ’ ’   she mocked him. ’ ’   there was the exchange wednesday during which she   grinned and interjected, as he was talking about sitting in an   apartment in his ”very beautiful hotel” in las vegas.  ’ ’   ”made with chinese steel,” she quipped. ’ ’   she outplayed and outprepared him. ’ ”   in the first debate, it was invoking  with whom trump engaged in a   feud. this   time, trump was so obsessed with defending himself against   allegations of sexual misconduct from several women that he   allowed her to completely avoid a question about former president   bill clinton’s own surreptitious history. ” ’   in slicing through his gop primary opponents, one by one, trump   often made other candidates the foil on the debate stage. his   most frequent target was jeb bush, whom he routinely made a   punchline. ’ ’   on wednesday night, at the end of three   debates,   he was his own punchline. ’ ’   ”nobody has more respect for women than i do. nobody,” he   declared. ’ ’   and the audience laughed. ’, Brett
